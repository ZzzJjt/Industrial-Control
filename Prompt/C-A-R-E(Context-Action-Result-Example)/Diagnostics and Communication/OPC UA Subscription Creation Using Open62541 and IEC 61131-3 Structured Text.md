**OPC UA Subscription Creation Using Open62541 and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a C function block for OPC UA subscription creation using the Open62541 library, which will be wrapped in IEC 61131-3 structured text code. The function block receives a Connection Handle as a DWORD and has the following inputs: an executed flag (BOOL), a priority (BYTE), and a timeout (TIME). As outputs, it provides three status flags (Done, Busy, Error) along with two DWORD outputs (ErrorID, SubscriptionHdl). The function block also includes an IN/OUT variable PublishingInterval (type TIME), which allows dynamic adjustment of the subscription interval.

In your explanation, describe how this C function block can be wrapped inside IEC 61131-3 structured text code, highlighting the integration steps and providing an example of how to call the function block within an ST program. Discuss error handling, subscription management, and real-time communication with OPC UA servers.

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

OPC UA is a powerful standard for real-time data communication in industrial systems, but many PLC environments lack native support for advanced features like subscriptions. To overcome this, developers often rely on C libraries such as open62541, which must be carefully integrated with IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) code to create reusable, real-time capable function blocks.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a C function block using the open62541 library to create OPC UA subscriptions. Wrap this logic within an IEC 61131-3 ST function block to expose it to the PLC runtime. The function block should provide:

Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL): Initiates subscription creation
	â€¢	ConnectionHdl (DWORD): The OPC UA session handle
	â€¢	Priority (BYTE): Priority of the subscription
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME): Maximum time to wait
	â€¢	PublishingInterval (IN/OUT, TIME): Adjustable data refresh interval

Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL): Subscription successfully created
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL): Operation in progress
	â€¢	Error (BOOL): An error occurred
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD): Specific error code
	â€¢	SubscriptionHdl (DWORD): Handle for managing the created subscription

The function block must handle execution logic, state transitions, and error feedback in both the C and ST layers.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The combined solution enables deterministic, real-time OPC UA subscription management from within a PLC program. Engineers can dynamically configure publishing intervals, handle session states, and receive precise diagnostic feedback. The approach enhances system flexibility and ensures high-performance connectivity with external OPC UA servers.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

In an IEC 61131-3 ST program, the function block can be called as follows:

SubscribeFB(
    Execute := TRUE,
    ConnectionHdl := SessionID,
    Priority := 1,
    Timeout := T#3s,
    PublishingInterval := IntervalVar,
    Done => SubDone,
    Busy => SubBusy,
    Error => SubError,
    ErrorID => SubErrorID,
    SubscriptionHdl => SubHandle
);

When Execute is triggered, the C layer communicates with the OPC UA server using the ConnectionHdl, configures the subscription with the given PublishingInterval and Priority, and returns a handle for further use. If successful, Done is set. If an error occurs, Error is raised and ErrorID provides a diagnostic code.
