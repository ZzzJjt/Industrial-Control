**Pick-and-Place Application for a Robot Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards for a pick-and-place robotic application with two conveyors, following the process described below:

Process Description:

The system operates in two modes: Manual Mode and Auto Mode. These modes are interlocked, meaning only one can be active at any time.

	1.	Manual Mode:
	â€¢	When the Manual button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the following steps in response to individual manual commands:
	â€¢	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A.
	â€¢	Transfer: Move the product to conveyor B.
	â€¢	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B, allowing it to be carried away.
	2.	Auto Mode:
	â€¢	When the Auto button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the entire pick-and-place process automatically:
	â€¢	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A and hold it.
	â€¢	Transfer: Transfer the product to conveyor B (this action takes 2 seconds).
	â€¢	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B.
	â€¢	The auto process completes after one cycle, but can be re-triggered by pressing the Auto button again.

The system should ensure that manual and auto modes cannot operate simultaneously, using interlocking logic to prevent conflicts between the two modes.

**C-A-R-E:**

Certainly! Hereâ€™s your prompt rewritten in C-A-R-E (Contextâ€“Actionâ€“Resultâ€“Example) format in English:

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In pick-and-place robotic systems, safe and reliable control depends on clear operating modes, effective interlocking, and precise sequence execution. A system with both manual and automatic modes must ensure that only one mode operates at a time and that transitions between modes are handled safely. Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, you can implement a programmable control logic that supports both manual step-wise control and one-shot automatic sequences.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Create a Structured Text program that:
	1.	Implements two interlocked modes:
	â€¢	Manual Mode is activated via a Manual button.
	â€¢	Auto Mode is activated via an Auto button.
	â€¢	The two modes are mutually exclusive (only one active at a time).
	2.	Defines Manual Mode behavior:
	â€¢	When ManualMode is active, the robot responds to individual manual commands:
	â€¢	Clip from Conveyor A
	â€¢	Transfer to Conveyor B
	â€¢	Release onto Conveyor B
	3.	Defines Auto Mode behavior:
	â€¢	When AutoMode is active and the Auto button is pressed:
	â€¢	Perform the sequence: Clip â†’ Transfer (2s delay) â†’ Release
	â€¢	Complete one full cycle per trigger (Auto button press)
	4.	Manages state transitions and interlocks safely:
	â€¢	Reset Auto mode trigger and timers between cycles
	â€¢	Prevent mixed-mode conflicts

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

This program ensures:
	â€¢	Safe and exclusive mode execution with interlocks
	â€¢	Manual flexibility for testing or maintenance
	â€¢	Automated repeatable cycles for production with timing control
	â€¢	A single, efficient Structured Text program thatâ€™s easy to maintain and extend with additional features like alarms, status indicators, or diagnostics
