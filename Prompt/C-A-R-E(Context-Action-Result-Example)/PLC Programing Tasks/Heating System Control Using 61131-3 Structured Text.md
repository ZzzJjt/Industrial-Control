**Heating System Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program (not a function block) to control the temperature of a heating system. The system should use input from three temperature sensors to automatically turn the heating on and off, maintaining a constant temperature range between 20Â°C and 22Â°C. The program must ensure smooth temperature regulation and prioritize energy efficiency by minimizing frequent switching. Safety measures should be implemented to handle sensor faults or temperature deviations beyond the specified range.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

Maintaining a stable temperature range in a heating system is critical for comfort, energy efficiency, and safety. When using multiple temperature sensors, itâ€™s essential to calculate a reliable average and include safety logic to handle sensor faults or abnormal temperature deviations. A well-structured IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program is ideal for managing this kind of control task in industrial or building automation environments.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Write a self-contained Structured Text (ST) program that performs the following:
	1.	Reads temperature from three sensors
	2.	Calculates the average temperature to ensure reliable control
	3.	Turns the heating ON when average temperature is below 20Â°C
	4.	Turns the heating OFF when average temperature is above 22Â°C
	5.	Implements hysteresis to avoid frequent toggling between ON/OFF states
	6.	Adds safety logic:
	â€¢	If any sensor reads below 10Â°C or above 30Â°C, treat it as a fault
	â€¢	In the event of a fault, turn off heating and flag the error

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The program will:
	â€¢	Maintain room temperature in the desired 20Â°Câ€“22Â°C range
	â€¢	Avoid frequent switching by using hysteresis control
	â€¢	Ensure safe operation by turning off the heating system if any sensor reports abnormal values
	â€¢	Be suitable for deployment on industrial PLCs for reliable, real-time temperature management

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Code Snippet
VAR
    TempSensor1, TempSensor2, TempSensor3 : REAL;
    AvgTemp : REAL;
    HeatingOn : BOOL := FALSE;
    SensorFault : BOOL := FALSE;
END_VAR

// Calculate average temperature
AvgTemp := (TempSensor1 + TempSensor2 + TempSensor3) / 3.0;

// Fault detection
IF (TempSensor1 < 10.0 OR TempSensor1 > 30.0) OR
   (TempSensor2 < 10.0 OR TempSensor2 > 30.0) OR
   (TempSensor3 < 10.0 OR TempSensor3 > 30.0) THEN
    SensorFault := TRUE;
    HeatingOn := FALSE;
ELSE
    SensorFault := FALSE;

    // Hysteresis control logic
    IF NOT HeatingOn AND AvgTemp < 20.0 THEN
        HeatingOn := TRUE;
    ELSIF HeatingOn AND AvgTemp > 22.0 THEN
        HeatingOn := FALSE;
    END_IF;
END_IF;
