**Coffee Maker Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text (ST) program to control a coffee machine that manages three tanks (coffee, milk, and mixer) and three valves (one for coffee, one for milk, and one for output). The machine should mix coffee and milk properly to create the best output, following this process:

System Description:

	1.	Tanks and Valves:
	â€¢	The coffee and milk valves open to fill the mixer tank. The mixer tank can hold up to 130ml, and when it reaches the maximum level, the coffee and milk valves will close.
	2.	Mixing Process:
	â€¢	Once the tank is full, the mixer starts automatically and runs for 4 seconds. After mixing is complete, the output valve opens to dispense the coffee.
	3.	Control Buttons:
	â€¢	Button 1: Emergency Stop â€” Stops the entire system instantly in case of malfunction, such as valve failures, tank level issues, or mixer failures.
	â€¢	Button 2: Start â€” Begins the coffee-making process.
	â€¢	Button 3: Coffee and Milk â€” Prepares coffee with milk by opening both the coffee and milk valves.
	â€¢	Button 4: Coffee Only â€” Prepares coffee without milk by only opening the coffee valve.

Safety Features:

	â€¢	Implement the emergency stop to handle unexpected events, such as valve malfunctions, tank level detection failures, or mixer operation failures. When triggered, the system should stop immediately to ensure safety.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

Automating a coffee machine with structured PLC control requires managing multiple components such as tanks, valves, a mixer, and operator inputs. Without clear logic and safety features like an emergency stop, the system may fail to prevent overflows, incomplete mixing, or even unsafe operation due to hardware malfunctions. A robust IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program ensures safe and precise control over every step of the process.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program for a single-station coffee machine that controls:
	â€¢	Three tanks:
	â€¢	Coffee tank
	â€¢	Milk tank
	â€¢	Mixer tank (capacity: 130ml)
	â€¢	Three valves:
	â€¢	Coffee valve
	â€¢	Milk valve
	â€¢	Output valve (dispenses mixed coffee)
	â€¢	One mixer unit
	â€¢	Four control buttons:
	â€¢	EmergencyStop â€“ instantly stops all operations
	â€¢	Start â€“ begins the coffee-making process
	â€¢	CoffeeMilk â€“ prepares coffee with milk
	â€¢	CoffeeOnly â€“ prepares coffee without milk
	â€¢	Logic flow:
	1.	Fill the mixer tank based on the selected mode (coffee only or coffee + milk)
	2.	Stop filling when the tank reaches 130 ml (MixerLevelFull = TRUE)
	3.	Run the mixer for 4 seconds
	4.	Open the output valve to dispense the beverage
	5.	Ensure emergency stop overrides all steps and halts the system immediately

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

This program will:
	â€¢	Safely control the complete coffee-making cycle from tank filling to dispensing
	â€¢	Handle both coffee-only and coffee-with-milk modes based on user input
	â€¢	Immediately interrupt all operations if an emergency is detected, protecting both the machine and the user
	â€¢	Be structured using state transitions for clarity and maintainability
	â€¢	Be suitable for deployment in real-world coffee vending systems with minimal adaptation
