**Elevator Control System Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program to control an elevator in a 5-floor building. Each floor has top and bottom limit switches to detect the elevatorâ€™s position. The elevator door should remain open for 7 seconds after reaching a floor. If no buttons inside the elevator cabin are pressed during this time, the door should reopen for an additional 10 seconds before closing. The elevatorâ€™s movement is governed by its current direction and the direction imposed by the up and down call buttons on each

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

Elevator systems in multi-floor buildings require precise coordination of motion control, door timing, and call handling logic to ensure safe, efficient, and user-friendly operation. In industrial automation, implementing such logic using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) is common, but it demands clear handling of state transitions, timers, and request queues for both cabin and floor buttons.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Develop a self-contained Structured Text program to control a 5-floor elevator system with the following behavior:
	â€¢	Position Detection:
	â€¢	Each floor has top and bottom limit switches or position flags (AtFloor[1..5]).
	â€¢	Door Logic:
	â€¢	When the elevator reaches a floor, the door opens and stays open for 7 seconds.
	â€¢	If no button is pressed inside the cabin during this time, the door reopens for an additional 10 seconds before closing.
	â€¢	Call Handling:
	â€¢	Handle calls from up/down buttons on each floor (UpCall[1..4], DownCall[2..5])
	â€¢	Handle cabin requests (CabinRequest[1..5])
	â€¢	Direction Control:
	â€¢	The elevator prioritizes servicing requests in the current direction.
	â€¢	When no further requests exist in the current direction, it reverses.
	â€¢	Safety Logic:
	â€¢	The elevator does not move while the door is open.
	â€¢	All pending requests must be processed before going idle.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The final program should:
	â€¢	Accurately manage elevator movement between floors
	â€¢	Open the door automatically for 7 seconds, and extend to 10 more seconds if no cabin request is made
	â€¢	Handle up/down calls and cabin requests intelligently based on direction
	â€¢	Avoid skipping floor requests and handle direction changes safely
	â€¢	Be fully modular, clear, and PLC-deployable following IEC 61131-3 standards

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Code Snippet
IF AtFloor[CurrentFloor] THEN
    DoorOpen := TRUE;
    DoorTimer1(IN := TRUE, PT := T#7s);

    IF DoorTimer1.Q THEN
        IF NOT AnyCabinRequest THEN
            DoorTimer2(IN := TRUE, PT := T#10s);
            IF DoorTimer2.Q THEN
                DoorOpen := FALSE;
            END_IF;
        ELSE
            DoorOpen := FALSE;
        END_IF;
    END_IF;
END_IF;

// Prevent motion while door is open
IF NOT DoorOpen THEN
    IF GoingUp THEN
        // Service next request above
    ELSIF GoingDown THEN
        // Service next request below
    END_IF;
END_IF;
