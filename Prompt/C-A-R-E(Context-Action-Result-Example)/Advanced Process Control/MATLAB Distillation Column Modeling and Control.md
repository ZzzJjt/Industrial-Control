**MATLAB Distillation Column Modeling and Control:**

Develop MATLAB code for a mathematical model of a distillation column, capturing its dynamic relationships between feed rates and temperature. Avoid plotting results.
Implement a model predictive control (MPC) scheme using the developed model to optimize the distillation process while considering operational constraints.


**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C（Context）

Distillation columns are critical in chemical processing, but their dynamic behavior—especially the nonlinear relationship between feed rates and temperature—makes modeling and control a challenging task. Traditional control methods may not provide optimal performance under changing conditions and operational constraints.

🟩 A（Action）

Develop MATLAB code to create a dynamic mathematical model of a distillation column that captures the interactions between feed rate changes and temperature evolution. Then, implement a model predictive control (MPC) scheme based on this model to optimize the distillation process, taking into account system constraints. Do not include any result plotting or visualization.

🟨 R（Result）

The result should be a simulation-ready model that can be used for predictive control tasks, providing optimized control actions that improve separation efficiency and maintain process stability, all within specified operational boundaries.

🟦 E（Example）

For instance, the model should handle scenarios such as a step change in feed composition or flow rate and still maintain desired product purity by adjusting control inputs proactively through the MPC strategy—all without requiring visual plots.
