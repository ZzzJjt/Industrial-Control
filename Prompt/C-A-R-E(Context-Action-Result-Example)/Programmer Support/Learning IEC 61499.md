**Learning IEC 61499:**
Provide a concise introduction to the IEC 61499 programming language, emphasizing key concepts for someone already familiar with IEC 61131-3. Include a comparison of their fundamental differences in terms of architecture, execution models, and flexibility for distributed control systems. Additionally, compile a list of five key references for further reading on IEC 61499, highlighting its relevance in modern industrial applications.

**C-A-R-E:**

üü• C (Context) ‚Äì Background

You are already knowledgeable in IEC 61131-3, the widely used standard for PLC programming in industrial automation. However, with the growing need for modular, event-driven, and distributed control systems, there‚Äôs increasing relevance for understanding IEC 61499, a newer standard that addresses these needs with a different architectural philosophy.

‚∏ª

üü© A (Action) ‚Äì What to Do

Create a concise introductory guide to IEC 61499 for users transitioning from IEC 61131-3. Your guide should:
	1.	Explain the core concepts of IEC 61499 (function blocks, event/data separation, distribution model).
	2.	Provide a comparative summary of IEC 61499 and IEC 61131-3 focusing on:
	‚Ä¢	Control architecture
	‚Ä¢	Execution model (event-driven vs. scan-based)
	‚Ä¢	Support for distributed automation
	3.	Highlight the advantages and flexibility IEC 61499 offers for modern industrial systems.
	4.	Compile five authoritative references for further learning.

‚∏ª

üü® R (Result) ‚Äì What You‚Äôll Achieve

This will give readers:
	‚Ä¢	A clear understanding of how IEC 61499 differs from and improves upon IEC 61131-3
	‚Ä¢	Insights into why and where IEC 61499 is used, especially in distributed systems
	‚Ä¢	A curated list of resources to deepen their knowledge and prepare for real-world application of IEC 61499
