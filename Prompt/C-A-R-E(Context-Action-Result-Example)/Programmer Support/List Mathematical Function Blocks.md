**List Mathematical Function Blocks:**
Compile a detailed list of all mathematical function blocks available in the OSCAT library for PLC programming, including a brief description of their functionality and typical use cases.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background

You are developing control logic using a PLC programming environment and leveraging the OSCAT library, a widely used open-source library for automation. The OSCAT library offers a large number of mathematical function blocks, but they are spread across modules and lack a centralized, user-friendly summary.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ What You Need to Do

Compile a detailed and organized list of all mathematical function blocks provided in the OSCAT library. For each function block, include:
	â€¢	The name of the block
	â€¢	A brief description of its function
	â€¢	Typical use cases in industrial automation (e.g., PID control, signal processing, data normalization)

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Value You Provide

The result will be a consolidated reference document that:
	â€¢	Helps developers quickly locate the right function block for a task
	â€¢	Saves time during development and troubleshooting
	â€¢	Increases code clarity and maintainability
	â€¢	Supports onboarding of new engineers by offering a readable overview of mathematical capabilities

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Suggested Format

## Trigonometric Function Blocks
- **SIN(x)** â€“ Calculates the sine of angle x (in radians).  
  *Use case*: Applied in motion control or waveform generation.

- **COS(x)** â€“ Returns the cosine of x.  
  *Use case*: Used in rotating system calculations and phase shifting.

## Algebraic Functions
- **SQRT(x)** â€“ Returns the square root of x.  
  *Use case*: Useful in geometric calculations and physics-based models.

## Statistical Functions
- **MEAN_ARRAY(array)** â€“ Calculates the average of elements in an array.  
  *Use case*: Real-time data smoothing in sensor fusion.

- **STDDEV_ARRAY(array)** â€“ Returns standard deviation of an array.  
  *Use case*: Used in quality control systems or anomaly detection.
