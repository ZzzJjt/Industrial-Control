ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Situation

You have an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program named UreaReactionControl, which manages a two-step urea synthesis reaction. It handles raw material intake (ammonia and COâ‚‚), checks for temperature and pressure within target ranges, and times the reaction process. While the code is functional, it lacks clear developer documentation, which hinders onboarding, maintenance, and compliance.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ What to Do

Generate detailed developer documentation for the program. The documentation should include:
	â€¢	Program purpose
	â€¢	Descriptions of variables: inputs, outputs, internal flags, and parameter constants
	â€¢	Step-by-step logic flow:
	â€¢	Step 1: Load ammonia and COâ‚‚
	â€¢	Step 2: Monitor and maintain reaction conditions (pressure & temperature)
	â€¢	Completion: Final shutdown and marking the process as finished
	â€¢	Clarify conditions for valve control and reaction timing
	â€¢	Highlight use of CURRENT_TIME and how it tracks duration

â¸»

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ What You Get

This will result in well-structured documentation that:
	â€¢	Allows developers and control engineers to quickly understand the logic
	â€¢	Serves as a technical reference for debugging and upgrades
	â€¢	Supports regulatory compliance and internal quality control
	â€¢	Increases team collaboration and reduces learning curves

## Developer Documentation: UreaReactionControl

### Purpose
This program automates the urea synthesis process by controlling input valves and monitoring reactor conditions. It ensures the process completes only when temperature and pressure are within tolerance for a sustained period.

### Variable Overview

#### Inputs
| Name                | Type  | Description                           |
|---------------------|--------|---------------------------------------|
| stAmmoniaValve      | BOOL | Status of the ammonia valve (read-only) |
| stCO2Valve          | BOOL | Status of the COâ‚‚ valve (read-only)     |
| rCurrentPressure    | REAL | Reactor pressure in bar                |
| rCurrentTemperature | REAL | Reactor temperature in Â°C              |

#### Outputs
| Name                  | Type  | Description                              |
|-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| stAmmoniaValveControl | BOOL | TRUE = open ammonia valve                |
| stCO2ValveControl     | BOOL | TRUE = open COâ‚‚ valve                    |

#### Parameters
| Parameter             | Value | Description                               |
|-----------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| rTargetPressure       | 175.0 | Target pressure in bar                    |
| rPressureTolerance    | 5.0   | Allowed Â± range for pressure              |
| rTargetTemperature    | 185.0 | Target temperature in Â°C                  |
| rTemperatureTolerance | 2.0   | Allowed Â± range for temperature           |
| tReactionTime         | 30m   | Total reaction duration                   |

### Program Logic

1. **Material Loading (Step 1)**
   - Opens both valves
   - Waits for confirmation that both are open
   - Begins timing the reaction

2. **Reaction Control (Step 2)**
   - Monitors current pressure & temperature
   - Ensures both are within tolerance
   - Continues until the timer reaches 30 minutes

3. **Shutdown**
   - Closes all valves
   - Marks the process as `stReactionFinished := TRUE`
