**Translate ST To Instruction List:**

Translate the following 61131-3 Structured Text program to 61131-3 Instruction List: PROGRAM PickAndPlace VAR ManualButton : BOOL; // Input signal for manual mode AutoButton : BOOL; // Input signal for auto mode ClipButton : BOOL; // Input signal for clip action TransferButton : BOOL; // Input signal for transfer action ReleaseButton : BOOL; // Input signal for release action ConveyorA : BOOL; // Input signal for presence of product on conveyor A ConveyorB : BOOL; // Output signal to control conveyor B RoboticArm : BOOL; // Output signal to control the robotic arm Mode : INT := 0; // Internal variable to store the current mode (0 = manual, 1 = auto) AutoProcess : BOOL := FALSE; // Internal variable to store whether the auto control process is currently running END_VAR

// Manual mode control process IF ManualButton THEN Mode := 0; // Set mode to manual END_IF

IF Mode = 0 THEN // Manual mode IF ClipButton AND ConveyorA THEN RoboticArm := TRUE; // Clip the product ELSIF TransferButton THEN ConveyorB := TRUE; // Transfer the product to conveyor B ELSIF ReleaseButton THEN ConveyorB := FALSE; // Release the product from conveyor B END_IF END_IF

// Auto mode control process IF AutoButton THEN Mode := 1; // Set mode to auto END_IF

IF Mode = 1 THEN // Auto mode IF NOT AutoProcess AND ConveyorA THEN // Only start the process if not currently running and there is a product on conveyor A AutoProcess := TRUE; // Set flag to indicate that the auto process is running RoboticArm := TRUE; // Clip the product WAIT 2; // Wait for 2 seconds to transfer the product ConveyorB := TRUE; // Transfer the product to conveyor B END_IF IF ConveyorB AND NOT ConveyorA THEN // Release the product from conveyor B once it has been transferred and there is no product on conveyor A ConveyorB := FALSE; AutoProcess := FALSE; // Clear the flag to indicate that the auto process is not running END_IF END_IF

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

IEC 61131-3 supports multiple programming languages for industrial automation, including Structured Text (ST) and Instruction List (IL). While ST is more readable and modern, IL is still used in legacy systems and low-level PLC environments. Translating between them is essential for compatibility and deployment across different PLC platforms.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Translate the provided Structured Text (ST) program for a PickAndPlace control sequence into its equivalent Instruction List (IL) form. The ST program includes variable declarations and control logic for manual and automatic operation modes of a robotic arm and conveyor system. The IL version should reflect identical control behavior, including conditional branching, variable assignments, and timing logic.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The resulting Instruction List code should preserve the same logic flow as the original ST program. It must correctly handle mode switching, manage signal inputs and outputs, and execute the auto-process sequence with proper synchronization, including wait timing and state resetsâ€”ready for use in an IL-compatible PLC system.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

For instance, the ST condition:

IF ManualButton THEN  
  Mode := 0;  
END_IF

LD ManualButton  
ST Mode
