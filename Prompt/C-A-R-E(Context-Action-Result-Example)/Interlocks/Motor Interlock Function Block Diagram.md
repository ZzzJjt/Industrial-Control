**Motor Interlock Function Block Diagram:**

Design a motor interlock as a function block diagram that prevents the motor from starting while other associated equipment is still running. The interlock should monitor the operational status of surrounding equipment and block the motor start command if any equipment is still active. Include inputs from sensors or status indicators and outputs that control the motor start circuit.

Provide the implementation of the MotorInterlock function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. This function block should check the statuses of relevant equipment (e.g., EquipmentRunning), and if all equipment is stopped, it should allow the motor to start by setting the output to TRUE. If any equipment is still running, the output should remain FALSE, preventing the motor from starting.

Discuss the role of motor interlocks in industrial safety and how this logic prevents premature or unsafe motor operation.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In many industrial systems, motors are interdependent with other equipment such as pumps, conveyors, or valves. Starting a motor while surrounding equipment is still running may cause mechanical damage, sequence errors, or unsafe operating conditions. To ensure safety and process integrity, motor start commands must be interlocked with the status of associated equipment.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Design a Motor Interlock Function Block Diagram and implement it in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The logic must:
	â€¢	Monitor the status of surrounding equipment using digital inputs such as Equipment1Running, Equipment2Running, etc.
	â€¢	Block the motor start if any of these inputs are TRUE (i.e., other equipment is active)
	â€¢	Set the output AllowStart := TRUE only when all equipment is inactive
	â€¢	Provide a function block (MotorInterlock) that is modular and reusable

Implementation structure:

FUNCTION_BLOCK MotorInterlock
VAR_INPUT
    Equipment1Running : BOOL;
    Equipment2Running : BOOL;
    Equipment3Running : BOOL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    AllowStart : BOOL;
END_VAR

AllowStart := NOT Equipment1Running AND NOT Equipment2Running AND NOT Equipment3Running;

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

This function block ensures that the motor only starts under safe conditions, preventing unintended operation during active sequences. It enhances operational safety, supports equipment coordination, and reduces the risk of mechanical failure or downtime caused by improper sequencing.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

In a mixing system, if Equipment1Running indicates that the agitator is active and Equipment2Running signals the tank feed pump is still flushing, then AllowStart := FALSE, and the motor cannot be started. Once both units are confirmed stopped, the operator can issue a valid start command, and AllowStart := TRUE.

This logic is essential for ensuring safe startup conditions, interlock chaining, and compliance with industrial automation safety standards.
