**PID Controller:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a PID controller. Include configurable parameters for proportional, integral, and derivative gains, with error handling and tuning capability.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Proportionalâ€“Integralâ€“Derivative (PID) controllers are essential in industrial automation for maintaining desired process conditions such as temperature, pressure, and flow. In a PLC environment, implementing a reliable and tunable PID algorithm in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text requires careful attention to execution safety, tuning flexibility, and prevention of issues like integral windup and unstable output response.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained PID controller function block in Structured Text that includes:
	â€¢	Configurable gain inputs:
	â€¢	Kp : REAL (proportional gain)
	â€¢	Ki : REAL (integral gain)
	â€¢	Kd : REAL (derivative gain)
	â€¢	Real-time error calculation between setpoint and process variable
	â€¢	Implementation of:
	â€¢	Integral term accumulation with anti-windup protection
	â€¢	Derivative action using past process variable
	â€¢	Output limits to prevent overcorrection
	â€¢	Inputs for Enable and Reset to control runtime execution
	â€¢	Optional tuning modes for gain adjustment during operation

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The function block should deliver stable and responsive control output across a range of operating conditions. It should be:
	â€¢	Scan-cycle safe and robust against input noise
	â€¢	Easy to integrate into broader control programs
	â€¢	Modular, with clear inputs and outputs
	â€¢	Suitable for use in both simulation and real-time industrial control applications

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Example logic structure:

IF Enable THEN
   Error := Setpoint - ProcessVariable;

   // Integral with anti-windup
   IF NOT Windup THEN
      Integral := Integral + (Ki * Error * DeltaT);
   END_IF;

   // Derivative
   Derivative := (ProcessVariable - PrevProcessVariable) / DeltaT;

   // PID output
   Output := Kp * Error + Integral - Kd * Derivative;

   // Clamping
   IF Output > MaxOutput THEN
      Output := MaxOutput;
      Windup := TRUE;
   ELSIF Output < MinOutput THEN
      Output := MinOutput;
      Windup := TRUE;
   ELSE
      Windup := FALSE;
   END_IF;
END_IF;

Inputs:
	â€¢	Setpoint, ProcessVariable, Kp, Ki, Kd, Enable, Reset, MinOutput, MaxOutput

Outputs:
	â€¢	Output, optionally Error, Integral, Derivative
