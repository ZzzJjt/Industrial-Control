**Binary Search:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform a binary search on an array of 100 integers. Include input validation and efficient handling of search boundaries.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In industrial automation systems, itâ€™s common to work with arrays of sensor readings, setpoints, or index values. Efficient data retrieval is essential, especially when scanning large arrays. A binary search algorithm is optimal for sorted integer arrays, offering logarithmic-time performance compared to linear search. Implementing such logic in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text allows for modular, real-time lookup operations on PLCs.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Create a self-contained function block in Structured Text to perform a binary search on an array of 100 integers. Your implementation should:
	â€¢	Take as input a sorted array, the target value, and an enable flag
	â€¢	Use Low, High, and Mid pointers to narrow the search space
	â€¢	Validate input conditions such as array bounds and search preconditions
	â€¢	Handle edge cases like an empty range or out-of-bounds indices
	â€¢	Output the index of the found value (or -1 if not found), and a boolean flag indicating success

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result should be a modular, reliable, and reusable binary search function block that runs efficiently on PLC hardware. It should minimize scan time for data lookups and be easily integrated into structured control applications that require high-speed decision-making or condition detection.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Hereâ€™s an excerpt of what the Structured Text logic might look like:

IF Enable THEN
   Low := 1;
   High := 100;
   Found := FALSE;

   WHILE (Low <= High) AND NOT Found DO
      Mid := (Low + High) / 2;
      IF SearchArray[Mid] = TargetValue THEN
         Index := Mid;
         Found := TRUE;
      ELSIF SearchArray[Mid] > TargetValue THEN
         High := Mid - 1;
      ELSE
         Low := Mid + 1;
      END_IF;
   END_WHILE;

   IF NOT Found THEN
      Index := -1;
   END_IF;
END_IF;
