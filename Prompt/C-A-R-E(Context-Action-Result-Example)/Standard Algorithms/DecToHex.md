**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

In industrial automation, converting decimal values to hexadecimal is essential for diagnostics, communication protocols, and memory addressing. However, IEC 61131-3 Structured Text does not always offer built-in methods to handle large decimal numbers (up to 10 digits) and edge cases such as zero or type overflow. A dedicated, reusable function block is needed to safely perform this conversion in scan-cycle-sensitive environments.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that:
	â€¢	Accepts a 10-digit decimal input (LINT type recommended)
	â€¢	Converts the value to a hexadecimal string output
	â€¢	Includes proper handling of edge cases, such as zero values and upper-limit overflow
	â€¢	Uses a loop to divide the decimal by 16, maps the remainder to its corresponding hex digit (0â€“F), and assembles the hex string in reverse order
	â€¢	Optionally trims leading zeros and provides a minimal-length result

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result should be a modular and scan-safe function block that can be integrated into any PLC program requiring decimal-to-hex conversion. It should ensure accuracy, support a wide input range, and be easy to reuse, maintain, and document, making it ideal for use in logging, HMI displays, and communication routines.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Hereâ€™s a conceptual snippet of the core logic:

WHILE DecValue > 0 DO
   Remainder := DecValue MOD 16;
   HexDigit := DigitMap[Remainder]; // e.g., DigitMap[10] = 'A'
   HexString := CONCAT(HexDigit, HexString); // prepend digit
   DecValue := DecValue / 16;
END_WHILE;

IF HexString = '' THEN
   HexString := '0'; // handle zero input
END_IF;
