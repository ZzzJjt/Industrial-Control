**Fast Fourier Transform:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a given input array. Ensure that the implementation is efficient and includes detailed comments explaining the algorithmic steps involved in computing the FFT. Discuss any limitations in terms of computational complexity and real-time performance, as well as considerations for handling input size constraints typically found in industrial control systems.

🟥 C (Context) – The Background

In industrial automation, real-time signal analysis—such as vibration, pressure, or electrical waveforms—is essential for condition monitoring, diagnostics, and predictive maintenance. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a powerful algorithm used to convert time-domain data into the frequency domain. However, implementing FFT on a PLC is challenging due to limited computational power, memory constraints, and strict scan-time requirements typical of IEC 61131-3 environments.

🟩 A (Action) – The Implementation Task

Design a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, named FFT_Block, that:
	•	Accepts a REAL input array (e.g., InputSignal: ARRAY[1..N] OF REAL, where N is a power of two)
	•	Computes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using an efficient algorithm such as radix-2 Cooley-Tukey
	•	Returns FFT results as:
	•	Amplitude spectrum (e.g., Amplitude[1..N/2]) or
	•	Complex components if imaginary parts are required
	•	Includes detailed inline comments explaining:
	•	The FFT stages (bit-reversal, twiddle factors, butterfly operations)
	•	Any normalization or scaling applied
	•	Uses preallocated arrays and bounded loops to ensure performance within PLC cycle time
	•	Optionally includes parameters for windowing or sample rate input

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – The Expected Outcome

The resulting function block enables the PLC to perform basic frequency analysis directly, making it suitable for tasks such as:
	•	Detecting vibration anomalies in motors
	•	Analyzing pump cavitation frequencies
	•	Monitoring power harmonics
	•	Triggering alarms based on dominant frequency bands

It also ensures that the FFT runs reliably within PLC memory and timing limits, avoiding watchdog errors or overflow.

🟦 E (Example) – A Practical Use Case

Suppose a 64-point sensor signal is collected from a vibration probe on a motor. This array is passed into FFT_Block. The block performs bit-reversal reordering, executes butterfly operations in-place, and returns the amplitude of the first 32 frequency bins. The result identifies a dominant frequency spike at 25 Hz, triggering a warning if it exceeds a defined threshold.
Example comment in code:
// Step 1: Reorder input using bit-reversal
// Step 2: Calculate twiddle factors and perform butterfly computation
// Step 3: Output magnitude spectrum for N/2 bins
