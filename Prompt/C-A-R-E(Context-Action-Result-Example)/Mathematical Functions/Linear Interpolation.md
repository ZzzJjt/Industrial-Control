**Linear Interpolation:**

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute linear interpolation between two points. Ensure the function block is designed for general use, with detailed comments explaining the mathematical formula behind the interpolation process. Discuss considerations for precision and potential rounding errors, as well as the function blockâ€™s suitability for use in industrial control systems where real-time responsiveness is critical.

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ The Background

In industrial automation, linear interpolation is frequently used to estimate unknown values between two measured or set pointsâ€”such as sensor scaling, actuator control, or temperature compensation. A reusable, well-documented function block is essential for ensuring accuracy and maintainability in real-time control systems, where precision and performance are both critical.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ The Implementation Task

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, named LinearInterpolation, that:
	â€¢	Accepts the following inputs:
	â€¢	X1, Y1: Coordinates of the first known point
	â€¢	X2, Y2: Coordinates of the second known point
	â€¢	X: The query point for which Y is interpolated
	â€¢	Computes the output Y using the linear interpolation formula:
Y := Y1 + ((X - X1) \times (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1)
	â€¢	Includes detailed inline comments explaining the math and each computation step
	â€¢	Handles edge cases such as X1 = X2 to avoid division by zero
	â€¢	Is designed to be lightweight and deterministic for real-time use

You should also document considerations like floating-point rounding errors and safety checks for unexpected input behavior.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ The Expected Outcome

The result is a reusable, general-purpose interpolation block that:
	â€¢	Can be integrated into HMI scaling, analog signal translation, or control logic
	â€¢	Ensures predictable and accurate behavior even under PLC execution time constraints
	â€¢	Minimizes rounding errors and improves reliability in process control applications

Itâ€™s suitable for use in production PLC code, across platforms such as Siemens, Beckhoff, and CODESYS.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ A Practical Use Case

Suppose you are scaling a temperature sensorâ€™s voltage output (e.g., 0.5â€¯V at 0Â°C, 2.5â€¯V at 100Â°C). Using LinearInterpolation, you input X1 := 0.5, Y1 := 0, X2 := 2.5, Y2 := 100, and a live voltage value X := 1.5. The function block returns Y = 50, accurately estimating the temperature.

Inline comment example:
// Check for zero denominator to avoid division error
IF X2 <> X1 THEN
    Y := Y1 + ((X - X1) * (Y2 - Y1)) / (X2 - X1);
ELSE
    Y := Y1; // Default or fallback value
END_IF;
