**P-ID Steam Water Cycle:**

Create a P&I diagram in textual notation for a steam water cycle in a power plant. Include equipment, instrumentation, piping, and control loops. Provide concrete tag names.

🟥 C (Context) – Background Situation

In power plant engineering, the steam-water cycle is a critical process that involves feedwater supply, steam generation, energy transfer, and condensate recovery. Typically, this system is documented using graphical Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs). However, in environments where visual tools aren’t available—such as early-stage design, textual documentation, or version-controlled environments—engineers often rely on structured textual notation to convey the same information effectively.

🟩 A (Action) – Task to Perform

Create a text-based P&ID for a steam-water cycle that includes:
	•	Process equipment (e.g., boiler, steam drum, feedwater pump, condenser)
	•	Instrumentation (e.g., pressure transmitters, level controllers, flow elements)
	•	Control loops with concrete tag names (e.g., FT101, FCV102, LT103)
	•	Piping flow paths clearly represented using arrows (-->) and structured indentation

Ensure the layout clearly communicates the relationship between instruments, control logic, and equipment within the system.

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – Expected Outcome

The result will be a readable, logically sequenced P&ID in textual format, suitable for:
	•	Early-stage design discussions
	•	Control narrative development
	•	Integration with PLC or DCS logic
	•	Documenting control loop structure for cross-disciplinary teams

It will serve as a bridge between process design and automation, even in environments where graphical diagrams are not practical.
