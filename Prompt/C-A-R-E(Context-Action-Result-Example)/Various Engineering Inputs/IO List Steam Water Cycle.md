**IO List Steam Water Cycle:**

Create an I/O list as a table for feedwater control in a steam-water cycle in a power plant. Have as columns names, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**C-A-R-E:**

🟥 C (Context) – Background Situation

In a steam-water cycle of a power plant, accurate and reliable feedwater control is essential to maintaining drum level stability, boiler protection, and steam production efficiency. Engineers require a detailed I/O list to properly define all instrumentation and control signals related to feedwater flow, level sensing, and valve positioning. Without this, inconsistencies can arise between P&ID diagrams, PLC configurations, and HMI development.

⸻

🟩 A (Action) – Task to Perform

Create a structured I/O list table for the feedwater control loop within the steam-water cycle. Each row in the table should describe one I/O signal and include the following columns:
	•	Signal Name
	•	Signal Tag Number
	•	Analog/Digital
	•	Engineering Unit
	•	Range
	•	Setpoint
	•	P&ID Reference

Include typical signals such as drum level transmitter, feedwater flow transmitter, feedwater control valve, and pump status.

⸻

🟨 R (Result) – Expected Outcome

The result will be a clear, accurate, and traceable I/O list that supports:
	•	PLC logic development
	•	Instrumentation wiring
	•	HMI tag mapping
	•	System integration based on P&ID alignment
This table will also aid in commissioning and maintenance by providing immediate reference to engineering values and operational settings.
