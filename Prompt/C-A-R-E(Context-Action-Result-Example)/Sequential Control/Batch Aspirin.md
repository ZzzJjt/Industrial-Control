**Batch Aspirin:**

Develop an ISA-88 batch control recipe for the production of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), outlining the process stages and the physical structure, which includes a reactor, crystallizer, centrifuge, and dryer. The process involves the following educts: acetic anhydride, salicylic acid, and sulfuric acid as a catalyst, with products being acetylsalicylic acid and acetic acid. The drying stage should occur at 90Â°C.

Write a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for the sequential control of the reaction stage, incorporating typical parameter values for temperature, pressure, and timing. Ensure that the program logic follows the batch control principles of ISA-88, with clear transitions between operations like heating, mixing, and reaction completion. Additionally, include control parameters for initiating and managing the crystallization and drying phases, ensuring that temperature and time controls are accurate.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is produced through a batch chemical process involving multiple stages and specialized equipment such as a reactor, crystallizer, centrifuge, and dryer. The process requires precise control of reaction parameters like temperature and pressure, especially during the reaction and drying stages. To ensure consistency, safety, and scalability, the implementation of ISA-88 standards is essential for structuring the control logic.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop an ISA-88 batch control recipe for aspirin production, detailing the physical and procedural models. Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that manages the reaction stage, using defined parameters for temperature, pressure, and reaction time. Ensure the logic includes clear transitions for operations such as heating, mixing, and reaction hold. Additionally, incorporate control structures to manage the crystallization and drying phases, where drying is to be performed at 90Â°C, with accurate time and temperature control logic.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result should be a modular, standards-compliant Structured Text program that reliably executes the key stages of aspirin production. The system should support consistent product quality, flexible control sequences, and clear integration of ISA-88 elements like equipment modules and procedural units.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

For example, during the reaction phase, the code should initiate StartHeating(Temp := 85) and begin a timer. Once the desired temperature is reached, it should transition to StartMixing(Speed := 300), followed by HoldReaction(Time := 25min, Temp := 85, Pressure := 1.5 bar). After reaction completion, the program should initiate crystallization, then control drying at Temp := 90Â°C for a specified duration using a dedicated phase logic block.
