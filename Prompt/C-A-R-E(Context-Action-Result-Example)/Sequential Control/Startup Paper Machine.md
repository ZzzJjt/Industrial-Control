**Startup Paper Machine:**

Develop a detailed startup sequence for the press section of a Valmet paper machine, specifying typical parameter values such as press roll speed, nip pressure, and temperature settings. The sequence should include the step-by-step activation of the press section components, ensuring proper synchronization between the rolls and conveyors, and gradually ramping up to the operational speed.

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control this startup sequence. The program should include logic for managing interlocks, safety checks, and smooth transitions between startup phases. Discuss the significance of maintaining optimal nip pressure and temperature throughout the process to prevent damage to the paper sheet and equipment.

**C-A-R-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

The press section of a Valmet paper machine is critical for removing water from the paper web and achieving uniform sheet properties. A poorly managed startup can lead to sheet breaks, press felt damage, and unsynchronized equipment, risking both product quality and machine safety. Parameters like nip pressure, press roll speed, and temperature must be precisely controlled and ramped up in a coordinated sequence. Implementing this startup using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text allows for repeatable, modular, and safe control logic.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Design a step-by-step startup sequence for the press section, including:
	â€¢	Initial condition checks (e.g., safety interlocks, drive readiness)
	â€¢	Sequential activation of conveyors and press rolls
	â€¢	Gradual ramp-up of roll speed (e.g., from 50 to 500 m/min)
	â€¢	Controlled nip pressure buildup (e.g., targeting 250 kN/m)
	â€¢	Temperature setpoint enforcement (e.g., 85â€“90Â°C) for press roll conditioning

Then, implement this sequence in a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program, including:
	â€¢	Logic for phase transitions
	â€¢	Timers and interlocks for safe state progression
	â€¢	Real-time synchronization checks between press rolls and web transport
	â€¢	Comments explaining safety checks and sequencing logic

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The result should be a modular, safety-oriented startup routine that ensures smooth press section engagement, optimal sheet handling, and minimal mechanical wear. The Structured Text program should be easy to maintain, scalable, and compliant with industrial standards for operational reliability and safety.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

Example of nip pressure ramp logic:

IF StartCommand AND AllDrivesReady THEN
   RampTimer(IN := TRUE, PT := T#10m);
   NipPressure := (RampTimer.ET / T#10m) * 250; // Linearly increase to 250 kN/m
END_IF;
