**3D Pouch Making Machine:**

Design a detailed start-up and shutdown sequence for a 3D pouch making machine in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The machine consists of 8 heating stations, 8 cooling stations, one horizontal cutter, one vertical cutter, and two feeder units responsible for raw material feeding. Winding tension management is critical throughout the process to ensure proper tension in the raw material.

Write a structured start-up sequence that sequentially activates the heating and cooling stations, regulates the feeder units to maintain optimal tension, and ensures proper synchronization between the cutters and material flow. Additionally, create a shutdown sequence that safely deactivates each component in the correct order, ensuring proper cooling and tension release.

Ensure the program includes typical parameter values, timers, and conditions for each stage of the start-up and shutdown procedures, and discuss the importance of winding tension in maintaining machine efficiency and product quality.

ðŸŸ¥ C (Context) â€“ Background Situation

A 3D pouch making machine consists of multiple subsystems: 8 heating stations, 8 cooling stations, horizontal and vertical cutters, and two feeder units for raw material supply. Managing these components requires precise coordination, especially in maintaining proper winding tension, which is critical for material alignment, product quality, and machine efficiency during both start-up and shutdown procedures.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ Task to Perform

Develop an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that defines a step-by-step start-up and shutdown sequence for the machine. The start-up sequence should initialize each subsystem in a logical orderâ€”heaters first, then coolers, followed by feeder units and synchronized cutter activationâ€”ensuring material tension is actively regulated. The shutdown sequence should ensure safe deactivation by releasing tension, cooling components, and stopping all cutters in the correct order. Include relevant timers, parameter thresholds, and interlocks.

ðŸŸ¨ R (Result) â€“ Expected Outcome

The final program should provide a reliable, safe, and efficient control procedure that prevents mechanical stress or product defects. The system should maintain consistent tension and temperature conditions, improve synchronization across all machine parts, and minimize downtime or waste during startup and shutdown transitions.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Example) â€“ Concrete Illustration

For example, in the start-up routine, the program should wait until all 8 heaters reach 180Â°C before enabling the feeder units. It should then monitor feeder speed and material tension before activating the cutters. In the shutdown phase, the system should turn off heaters, allow coolers to run for a set time, gradually stop feeder units, and finally disengage both cuttersâ€”ensuring all residual tension is released safely.
