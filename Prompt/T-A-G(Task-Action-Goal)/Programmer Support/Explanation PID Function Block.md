ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Explain the function and structure of the PID function block in the OSCAT library, including its inputs, outputs, and how it is practically used for process control in industrial applications.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How It Works
	1.	Inputs:
	â€¢	SP (Setpoint): The desired target value of the process (e.g., 75Â°C).
	â€¢	PV (Process Variable): The actual measured value (e.g., current temperature).
	â€¢	Kp, Ki, Kd: Tuning constants that define proportional, integral, and derivative behavior.
	â€¢	Optional: MANUAL mode for overriding automatic control, and LIMIT_HI / LIMIT_LO for output clamping.
	2.	Processing:
	â€¢	Computes Error := SP - PV.
	â€¢	Calculates:
	â€¢	Proportional Term: Kp * error
	â€¢	Integral Term: Ki * âˆ« error dt (to remove steady-state offset)
	â€¢	Derivative Term: Kd * d(error)/dt (to dampen sudden changes)
	â€¢	Combines these to form the control signal (OUT), with output limiting and anti-windup protection.
	3.	Outputs:
	â€¢	OUT: The control signal to the actuator (e.g., valve position, motor speed).
	â€¢	ERROR: Real-time deviation between SP and PV.
	â€¢	Status flags: Such as saturation indicators (if limits are reached).

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Achieve

By using the OSCAT PID function block, you can:
	â€¢	Maintain stable and accurate control over critical process parameters like pressure, temperature, or flow.
	â€¢	Optimize process performance through real-time corrections.
	â€¢	Reduce manual tuning and improve fault resilience with built-in saturation and mode-handling features.
	â€¢	Apply PID logic to a wide variety of automation scenarios, from chemical dosing to speed regulation and HVAC systems.
