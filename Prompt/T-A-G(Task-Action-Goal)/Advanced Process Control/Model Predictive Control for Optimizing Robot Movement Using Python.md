**Model Predictive Control for Optimizing Robot Movement Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the movement of a robot. The control system should consider dynamic constraints, path planning, and obstacle avoidance while ensuring smooth, efficient, and adaptive movement in a dynamic environment.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ Tï¼ˆTaskï¼‰

Design and implement a model predictive control (MPC) system in Python to optimize a robotâ€™s movement in dynamic environments.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆActionï¼‰

Develop a motion model of the robot and implement an MPC algorithm that handles path planning, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic constraints such as velocity, acceleration, and turning limits. Simulate various environments with moving or static obstacles to evaluate the robotâ€™s performance.

ðŸŸ¦ Gï¼ˆGoalï¼‰

Achieve smooth, adaptive, and efficient robot navigation that responds intelligently to environmental changes, ensuring safe motion and optimal path execution in real time.
