**SCD LNG Vaporizer:**

Create a NORSOK system control diagram (SCD) in textual notation for a LNG Vaporizer System. Include instrumentation, control loops, and interlocks. Provide concrete tag numbers and piping.


**T-A-G:**

🟥 T (Task)

Develop a NORSOK-compliant System Control Diagram (SCD) in textual notation for an LNG vaporizer system.

⸻

🟩 A (Action)
	•	Outline the full process flow from LNG inlet to gas outlet using arrows (-->) to indicate direction.
	•	Include all relevant instrumentation and control loops, such as:
	•	Flow control loop: FT201 → FIC201 → FCV201
	•	Temperature control loop: TT101 → TIC101 → TCV101
	•	Add interlocks for critical conditions like overpressure and overtemperature, e.g.:
	•	PSH301 → ESD1 (Shut Heater Steam)
	•	TSH302 → ESD2 (Block LNG Inlet)
	•	Assign realistic tag numbers to all instruments and final control elements.
	•	Organize the text into clear sections for process flow, control loops, and safety logic.

⸻

🟦 G (Goal)

Produce a structured and readable textual SCD that reflects the control philosophy, instrumentation layout, and safety systems of the LNG vaporizer process—serving as a reference for control system design, HAZOP studies, and compliance with NORSOK I-005 standards.
