**PFD Penicillin Fermentation:**

Create a Process Flow Diagram (PFD) in textual notation for a fermentation process to produce penicillin. Include instrumentation and control philosophy.


**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop a text-based Process Flow Diagram (PFD) for a penicillin fermentation process, suitable for engineering documentation and control design.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	List the major unit operations in sequential order, such as:
Water Tank --> Nutrient Mixer --> Sterilizer --> Fermenter --> Separator --> Product Tank
	â€¢	For each unit, add associated instrumentation using standard tag formats (e.g., TT101, pH201, FIC301).
	â€¢	Describe basic control loops, such as:
	â€¢	Temperature control using: TT201 â†’ TIC201 â†’ TCV201
	â€¢	pH adjustment via: pH202 â†’ PIC202 â†’ Base Pump
	â€¢	Format the diagram in clear plain text, using arrows (-->) to indicate material flow and indentations for instrumentation and control strategies.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Produce a clear, structured, and implementation-ready textual PFD that outlines both the process flow and the control philosophy for penicillin fermentation. This format should help cross-disciplinary teamsâ€”from process design to automationâ€”understand the flow and control logic without needing graphical tools.
