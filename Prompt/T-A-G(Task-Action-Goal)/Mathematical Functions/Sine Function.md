**Sine Function**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the sine of a given angle in radians. Ensure that the function block is modular and reusable, with appropriate comments detailing the mathematical operations involved. Include a discussion on the precision of the sine function within the context of PLC programming and its potential limitations in real-time applications.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block that calculates the sine of a given angle expressed in radians. The function block should be accurate, reusable, and suitable for real-time execution on a PLC.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Define a function block named SineFunction with:
	â€¢	Input:
	â€¢	AngleRad : REAL â€” angle in radians
	â€¢	Output:
	â€¢	SineValue : REAL â€” the computed sine of the input angle
	2.	Implement the sine calculation using either:
	â€¢	The built-in SIN() function:
SineValue := SIN(AngleRad);
	3.	Include detailed inline comments to:
	â€¢	Explain why radians are used instead of degrees
	â€¢	Clarify the series expansionâ€™s terms and their convergence characteristics
	â€¢	Warn that input normalization may be needed for large angles
	4.	Ensure the block:
	â€¢	Executes deterministically
	â€¢	Avoids recursion or dynamic memory
	â€¢	Is portable across PLC platforms

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Deliver a lightweight, reusable, and real-time safe function block that:
	â€¢	Computes sine values accurately within a bounded input range
	â€¢	Can be integrated into industrial control tasks like:
	â€¢	Waveform generation
	â€¢	Motion path planning
	â€¢	Oscillatory control signals
	â€¢	Works reliably on PLC platforms that may or may not support built-in trigonometric functions

This function block improves flexibility in control applications and ensures your logic remains platform-independent and maintainable.
