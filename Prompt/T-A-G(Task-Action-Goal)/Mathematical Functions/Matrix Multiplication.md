**Matrix Multiplication:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 to perform multiplication of two 4x4 matrices. Ensure that the implementation adheres to the standards of structured text programming and includes detailed comments explaining each part of the process. Discuss the computational complexity and potential limitations when scaling this approach to larger matrices.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to perform multiplication of two 4Ã—4 matrices. This block should be reusable in industrial applications such as robotics, motion control, or transformation operations.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Define the function block MatrixMultiply4x4 with the following structure:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	MatrixA: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL
	â€¢	MatrixB: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL
	â€¢	Output:
	â€¢	MatrixC: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL (the product of A Ã— B)
	2.	Implement matrix multiplication logic using three nested FOR loops:
	â€¢	Outer loops iterate through rows of MatrixA and columns of MatrixB
	â€¢	Inner loop performs the dot product and accumulates the result in MatrixC[i,j]
	â€¢	Example:
 
 FOR i := 1 TO 4 DO
    FOR j := 1 TO 4 DO
        MatrixC[i,j] := 0;
        FOR k := 1 TO 4 DO
            MatrixC[i,j] := MatrixC[i,j] + MatrixA[i,k] * MatrixB[k,j];
        END_FOR;
    END_FOR;
END_FOR;

	3.	Comment each part of the code to explain:
	â€¢	The role of each index
	â€¢	Why initialization to zero is important
	â€¢	How the algorithm scales computationally (O(nÂ³))
	4.	Address limitations:
	â€¢	Scaling to larger matrices may impact scan time
	â€¢	Fixed array sizes restrict dynamic use cases
	â€¢	Consider memory and performance trade-offs for real-time systems

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Deliver a robust, efficient, and easy-to-maintain function block that enables real-time matrix multiplication in PLC environments. This block should:
	â€¢	Be compliant with IEC 61131-3 standards
	â€¢	Support deterministic execution for time-critical control loops
	â€¢	Be reusable in applications like:
	â€¢	Robot arm pose calculations
	â€¢	3D coordinate transformation
	â€¢	Kinematic chain modeling
