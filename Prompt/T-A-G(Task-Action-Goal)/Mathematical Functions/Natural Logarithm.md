**Natural Logarithm:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the natural logarithm of a given input. Ensure that the implementation is efficient and well-documented, with comments explaining the mathematical foundation of the natural logarithm. Additionally, address potential edge cases, such as handling non-positive inputs, and discuss the precision and performance of this function block in typical industrial applications.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Design a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that computes the natural logarithm of a given real input value. The block should be reusable, safe, and suitable for use in real-time industrial control systems.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Create a function block named NaturalLog with:
	â€¢	Input:
	â€¢	X : REAL â€” the number to compute ln(X)
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	LnX : REAL â€” the result of ln(X)
	â€¢	Error : BOOL â€” set to TRUE if X â‰¤ 0, indicating an invalid input
	2.	Implement the logic:
	â€¢	Use the built-in LN() function for valid inputs:

 IF X > 0.0 THEN
    LnX := LN(X);
    Error := FALSE;
ELSE
    LnX := 0.0;
    Error := TRUE;
END_IF;

	â€¢	Add inline comments explaining:
	â€¢	ln(X) is undefined for X â‰¤ 0
	â€¢	Why Error is raised for domain violations
	â€¢	How the function is kept simple and deterministic for PLC use

	3.	Ensure compatibility and efficiency:
	â€¢	Avoid recursion or dynamic structures
	â€¢	Ensure all code executes predictably within a scan cycle
	â€¢	Optionally include versioning or diagnostic codes for system integration

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

Deliver a robust and reusable logarithm function block that:
	â€¢	Handles invalid input safely and predictably
	â€¢	Can be used in real-time PLC applications like:
	â€¢	Sensor signal scaling
	â€¢	Flow computation with exponential behavior
	â€¢	Energy modeling using logarithmic relationships
	â€¢	Provides clear feedback and documentation for system diagnostics and maintenance
