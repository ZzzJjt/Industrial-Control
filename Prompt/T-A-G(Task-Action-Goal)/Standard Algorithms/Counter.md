**Counter:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text for a digital counter with up/down counting modes. Include configurable initial value, step size, and overflow handling.


**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that implements a configurable digital counter with both up and down counting modes.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define inputs for:
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL â€“ activates the counter
	â€¢	CountUp : BOOL â€“ selects the counting direction
	â€¢	StepSize : INT â€“ amount to increment or decrement
	â€¢	InitValue : INT â€“ starting value of the counter
	â€¢	Reset : BOOL â€“ resets the counter to the initial value
	â€¢	MaxValue / MinValue : INT â€“ upper and lower bounds for overflow handling
	â€¢	Use conditional logic to increment or decrement based on CountUp
	â€¢	Implement logic to clamp the value within MinValue and MaxValue
	â€¢	Provide outputs for:
	â€¢	CurrentValue : INT â€“ the current counter state
	â€¢	AtMax, AtMin : BOOL â€“ flags for boundary conditions
	â€¢	Comment all key sections to ensure clarity and reusability

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a modular, safe, and easy-to-integrate counter block suitable for PLC applications requiring flexible and bounded counting logic. The implementation should be robust, configurable, and reliable for use in scan-cycle-sensitive automation environments.
