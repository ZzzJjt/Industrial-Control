**DecToHex:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert a 10-digit decimal value to hexadecimal. Ensure proper handling of large values and edge cases.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Create a function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that converts a 10-digit decimal value into its hexadecimal representation.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Define inputs and outputs:
	â€¢	Input: DecValue : LINT
	â€¢	Output: HexString : STRING
	â€¢	Use a loop-based algorithm to:
	â€¢	Repeatedly divide the decimal number by 16
	â€¢	Map each remainder to its corresponding hexadecimal digit (0â€“F)
	â€¢	Construct the hex string in reverse order, then output the result
	â€¢	Implement edge case handling, such as:
	â€¢	Input = 0 â†’ Output = '0'
	â€¢	Large number limits â†’ safe type casting and bounds checking
	â€¢	Add clear comments and use internal variables for modularity and clarity

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a robust, reusable, and scan-cycle-safe function block that reliably converts large decimal values to hexadecimal. The block should support integration with diagnostics, HMI displays, and protocol encoders, while handling all typical boundary conditions safely and efficiently.
