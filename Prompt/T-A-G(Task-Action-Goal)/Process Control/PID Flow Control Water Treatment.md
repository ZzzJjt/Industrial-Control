**PID Flow Control Water Treatment:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for chemical dosing in a water treatment process. The program should regulate the dosing rate of chlorine at 3 ppm, adjusting based on real-time flow measurements with a sampling rate of 100 ms.

The control logic should include PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) that are tuned for maintaining the desired dosing concentration. Ensure the program accounts for any deviations from the setpoint and adjusts the chemical dosing accordingly, while including safety limits to prevent overdosing or underdosing. Discuss the importance of precise flow control in water treatment, with a focus on maintaining safe and effective chemical levels.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) that uses PID feedback control to regulate the chlorine dosing rate in a water treatment system. The target dosing level is 3 ppm, and the system must respond to real-time flow measurements sampled every 100 milliseconds.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Read process inputs:
	â€¢	Dosing_PV: Measured chlorine concentration (ppm)
	â€¢	FlowRate: Water flow rate (optional/future use)
	2.	Calculate error between the setpoint (Dosing_SP := 3.0 ppm) and the measured value.
	3.	Apply PID logic using predefined gains:
	â€¢	Proportional (Kp := 2.0)
	â€¢	Integral (Ki := 0.5)
	â€¢	Derivative (Kd := 0.1)
	4.	Update internal states: accumulate the integral and compute the derivative based on the error change.
	5.	Clamp the output (Dosing_Output) between Min_Dose := 0.0 and Max_Dose := 10.0 to ensure safe operation.
	6.	Output the result to control the dosing pump.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

The program should:
	â€¢	Accurately regulate the chlorine concentration at the desired 3 ppm
	â€¢	React quickly to flow fluctuations and dosing deviations
	â€¢	Prevent underdosing or overdosing with built-in safety limits
	â€¢	Be suitable for real-time PLC deployment in industrial water treatment systems
