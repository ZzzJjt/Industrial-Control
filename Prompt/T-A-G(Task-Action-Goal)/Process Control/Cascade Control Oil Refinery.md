**Cascade Control Oil Refinery:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement cascade control for pressure regulation in an oil refinery vessel. The primary loop should control the vessel pressure, adjusting the pressure setpoint based on the process requirements. The secondary loop controls the flow of oil into the vessel, with the output of the primary loop serving as the setpoint for the secondary loop.

Ensure that the program manages the interaction between the two control loops, allowing the inner loop (oil flow control) to respond rapidly to changes in flow while the outer loop (pressure control) maintains overall process stability. Include typical parameter values for pressure and flow control, and discuss the benefits of cascade control in oil refinery operations, particularly for improving response time and process stability in systems with large disturbances.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement cascade control for pressure regulation in an oil refinery vessel. The system should coordinate two control loops to maintain stable operation under varying conditions.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Design the Outer Loop (Primary Control â€“ Pressure):
	â€¢	Compare the vessel pressure setpoint (Pressure_SP := 12.0) with the measured pressure (Pressure_PV).
	â€¢	Calculate the pressure error and use a proportional controller (Kp_Outer := 1.2) to generate a flow rate setpoint (Flow_SP).
	2.	Design the Inner Loop (Secondary Control â€“ Flow):
	â€¢	Compare the generated Flow_SP with the actual oil inflow rate (Flow_PV).
	â€¢	Calculate the flow error and apply proportional control (Kp_Inner := 2.5) to produce an output signal (Flow_Output) that adjusts the flow actuator (e.g., valve or pump).
	3.	Program Structure:
	â€¢	Ensure inner loop executes faster and more frequently than the outer loop.
	â€¢	Maintain clarity with commented, modular logic for easy tuning and scalability.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve

The final control system should:
	â€¢	Provide fast response to oil inflow disturbances via the inner loop
	â€¢	Maintain stable vessel pressure through coordinated outer-loop control
	â€¢	Be PLC-ready, maintainable, and serve as a reusable template for other cascade control applications in refinery systems
	â€¢	Demonstrate the efficiency and stability improvements cascade control offers over single-loop methods

âœ… Example Code (Structured Text)
VAR
    // Outer loop: pressure control
    Pressure_SP : REAL := 12.0;
    Pressure_PV : REAL;
    Pressure_Error : REAL;
    Flow_SP : REAL;

    // Inner loop: flow control
    Flow_PV : REAL;
    Flow_Error : REAL;
    Flow_Output : REAL;

    // Gains
    Kp_Outer : REAL := 1.2;
    Kp_Inner : REAL := 2.5;
END_VAR

// Outer loop: pressure regulation
Pressure_Error := Pressure_SP - Pressure_PV;
Flow_SP := Kp_Outer * Pressure_Error;

// Inner loop: flow regulation
Flow_Error := Flow_SP - Flow_PV;
Flow_Output := Kp_Inner * Flow_Error;

// Flow_Output controls the oil inlet valve
