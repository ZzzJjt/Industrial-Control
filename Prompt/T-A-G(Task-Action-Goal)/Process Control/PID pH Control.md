**PID pH Control:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement PID feedback control for pH regulation in a process. The program should continuously adjust the addition of acid or base to maintain the pH setpoint, ensuring accurate control in dynamic conditions.

Include the PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and the control logic to handle deviations from the target pH. The program should incorporate safeguards to prevent extreme pH levels by setting operational limits for the dosing mechanism. Discuss the challenges of pH control in industrial processes, particularly focusing on system response time, non-linear behavior of pH control, and maintaining process stability under varying input conditions.

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement PID feedback control for pH regulation in a process. The control system should dynamically adjust acid or base dosing to maintain a defined pH setpoint in real time.

ðŸŸ© A (Action) â€“ How to Do It
	1.	Monitor the current pH value (pH_PV) from the sensor.
	2.	Compare it to a desired setpoint (pH_SP := 7.0) to calculate the error.
	3.	Apply the PID control algorithm using:
	â€¢	Kp := 2.5 (proportional gain)
	â€¢	Ki := 0.6 (integral gain)
	â€¢	Kd := 0.3 (derivative gain)
	4.	Update every 100 ms, calculating the PID output (Dosing_Output) to determine the dosing rate.
	5.	Clamp the dosing output between 0.0 and 100.0 to ensure safe operation and prevent pH overshoot or system damage.
	6.	Store the previous error for use in the next loop cycle.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal) â€“ What You Want to Achieve
	â€¢	Maintain a stable and accurate pH level within the desired range
	â€¢	Respond quickly and safely to disturbances and dynamic changes in process conditions
	â€¢	Avoid extreme pH deviations by limiting actuator output
	â€¢	Create a robust, PLC-deployable program that supports industrial pH control in chemical, water treatment, or bioprocess systems

    pH_SP : REAL := 7.0;               // Target setpoint

    // PID tuning parameters
    Kp : REAL := 2.5;
    Ki : REAL := 0.6;
    Kd : REAL := 0.3;

    // Control variables
    Error : REAL;

    // Safety limits
    Dosing_Min : REAL := 0.0;
    Dosing_Max : REAL := 100.0;
END_VAR

// PID execution cycle (every 100 ms)
Error := pH_SP - pH_PV;
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1;
Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1;

Dosing_Output := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative);

// Clamp output

    Dosing_Output := Dosing_Max;
