**Startup Steam Generator:**

Develop a non-linear model-predictive controller (NMPC) in Python to optimize the startup process of a steam generator in a power plant. The NMPC should be designed to handle the non-linear dynamics of the steam generation process, considering key variables such as pressure, temperature, and flow rates. The controller must minimize startup time while maintaining safety and operational constraints.

Ensure that the Python implementation is modular, with clear explanations of the optimization algorithm, control horizon, and prediction model. Discuss the benefits of using NMPC for steam generator startup, particularly in terms of energy efficiency and system stability, and highlight the challenges associated with controlling such a complex non-linear process.

**T-A-G:**

ðŸŸ¥ T (Task)

Develop a non-linear model predictive controller (NMPC) in Python to optimize the startup process of a steam generator in a power plant.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© A (Action)
	â€¢	Model the non-linear dynamics of the steam generator, focusing on key variables like temperature, pressure, and flow rate.
	â€¢	Design the NMPC to minimize startup time while maintaining strict safety and operational constraints.
	â€¢	Structure your Python code into modular components, such as:
	â€¢	A process model (e.g., system of ODEs or data-driven surrogate)
	â€¢	An NMPC optimization loop (e.g., using CasADi, GEKKO, or Pyomo)
	â€¢	Constraint handling (e.g., temperature â‰¤ 520Â°C, pressure â‰¥ 30 bar)
	â€¢	Provide clear documentation for the prediction model, control horizon, and solver logic.
	â€¢	Discuss how NMPC offers energy efficiency, stability, and better constraint handling than traditional methods, along with implementation challenges like real-time feasibility and model tuning.

ðŸŸ¦ G (Goal)

Deliver a robust, well-structured Python-based NMPC system capable of executing a fast, safe, and efficient startup for a steam generator. The solution should demonstrate modularity, transparency, and the ability to adapt to complex non-linear process dynamics while improving operational performance.
