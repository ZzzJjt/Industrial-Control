**Motor Interlock Function Block Diagram:**

Design a motor interlock as a function block diagram that prevents the motor from starting while other associated equipment is still running. The interlock should monitor the operational status of surrounding equipment and block the motor start command if any equipment is still active. Include inputs from sensors or status indicators and outputs that control the motor start circuit.

Provide the implementation of the MotorInterlock function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. This function block should check the statuses of relevant equipment (e.g., EquipmentRunning), and if all equipment is stopped, it should allow the motor to start by setting the output to TRUE. If any equipment is still running, the output should remain FALSE, preventing the motor from starting.

Discuss the role of motor interlocks in industrial safety and how this logic prevents premature or unsafe motor operation.

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

In industrial systems, motors often operate in coordination with other equipment such as pumps, conveyors, or agitators. Starting a motor while associated equipment is still running can cause mechanical conflict, equipment damage, or unsafe operating conditions. Without a proper interlock mechanism, the motor may receive a start command at an unsafe time, posing a risk to both personnel and system integrity.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Design a Motor Interlock Function Block Diagram and implement it in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The function block, called MotorInterlock, should:
	â€¢	Receive input signals indicating the operational status of other equipment (e.g., Equipment1Running, Equipment2Running)
	â€¢	Block the motor start if any input signal indicates active equipment
	â€¢	Allow the motor to start by setting output AllowStart := TRUE only when all equipment is stopped

This ensures that the motor cannot be energized unless the system is in a defined safe state, reducing risk and promoting safe sequencing.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

To implement this logic:
	1.	Declare the function block with boolean inputs for each monitored equipment status:
 FUNCTION_BLOCK MotorInterlock
VAR_INPUT
    Equipment1Running : BOOL;
    Equipment2Running : BOOL;
    Equipment3Running : BOOL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    AllowStart : BOOL;
END_VAR
	2.	Write the interlock logic to allow start only when all monitored equipment are not running:
 AllowStart := NOT Equipment1Running AND NOT Equipment2Running AND NOT Equipment3Running;
 	3.	Deploy this function block in the main program or safety logic, linking it to motor control circuits and operator panels.
	4.	Explain its purpose: This interlock prevents premature motor starts, protects mechanical systems from conflict, and ensures operators follow proper sequenceâ€”essential for interlocked process chains, batch controls, and rotating machinery safety.
