**SFC Traffic Light:**

Create a 61131-3 sequential function chart in ASCII art for a traffic light. Include proper delays for switching the lights.

🟥 B (Before) – The Problem or Challenge

When designing a traffic light control system using IEC 61131-3, it’s important to clearly represent the sequential logic of light transitions (green → yellow → red → green) with appropriate timing delays. In situations where graphical tools are not available—such as for documentation, version control, or early-stage logic planning—engineers need a way to express Sequential Function Charts (SFCs) using plain-text or ASCII art. Without a structured textual layout, the sequence flow and timing logic can become confusing or miscommunicated.

⸻

🟩 A (After) – The Desired Outcome

Create a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) in ASCII art that models the behavior of a standard traffic light system. The chart should:
	•	Follow IEC 61131-3 syntax and logic structure
	•	Include steps for Green, Yellow, and Red lights
	•	Use transitions between steps with clear conditions
	•	Implement delays/timers between transitions (e.g., 5s green, 2s yellow, 5s red)
	•	Be clearly formatted to show the flow from one step to the next in a loop

🟧 B (Bridge) – How to Get There
	1.	Define three steps: S1: Green, S2: Yellow, S3: Red
	2.	Place transitions between steps with timing conditions such as T#5s or tGreen.Q
	3.	Format the diagram using ASCII blocks for clarity, for example:

 +------------+     tGreen.Q     +-------------+     tYellow.Q     +-----------+
| Green Light|---------------->| Yellow Light|------------------>| Red Light |
|  TON: tGreen                  |  TON: tYellow                 |  TON: tRed |
+------------+                 +-------------+                 +-----------+
        ^                                                                 |
        |                                                                 |
        +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
                         tRed.Q (after 5s)
