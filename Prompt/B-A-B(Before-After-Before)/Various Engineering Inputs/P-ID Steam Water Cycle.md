**P-ID Steam Water Cycle:**

Create a P&I diagram in textual notation for a steam water cycle in a power plant. Include equipment, instrumentation, piping, and control loops. Provide concrete tag names.

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In a power plantâ€™s steam-water cycle, effective communication between design, control, and operations teams depends on clear and consistent Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs). When graphical tools arenâ€™t available or when quick documentation is needed, a text-based P&ID can help bridge understanding. However, without standardized textual notation, equipment relationships, signal flow, and control loops may be ambiguous or misinterpreted.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a text-based P&ID representation of the steam-water cycle in a power plant that clearly includes:
	â€¢	Major equipment (e.g., boiler, drum, condenser, pumps)
	â€¢	Instrumentation (e.g., level transmitters, flow meters, pressure sensors)
	â€¢	Piping connections and flow direction
	â€¢	Control loops with specific tag names for valves and transmitters (e.g., LT101, FCV201)

This P&ID should be readable in a plain-text format and structured in a way that conveys both process flow and instrumentation logic, enabling control system development and documentation review.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Identify and list core process equipment: e.g., Boiler (B01), Feedwater Pump (P01), Steam Drum (D01), Condenser (C01).
	2.	Assign tag names to instruments using common standards: LT (Level Transmitter), FT (Flow Transmitter), FCV (Flow Control Valve), etc.
	3.	Use arrows (-->) to show flow direction, and brackets or colons to denote control actions.
	4.	Group items by subsystem (feedwater, steam generation, condensation) and ensure clear loop references, such as:
	â€¢	FT101 --> FIC101 --> FCV101
	â€¢	D01:LT102 --> LIC102 --> LV102
	5.	Present the full steam-water cycle from feedwater entry to steam exit and condensation recovery in clear, sequenced lines of text.
