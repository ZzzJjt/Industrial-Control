ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

Designing a NORSOK-compliant System Control Diagram (SCD) for a LNG vaporizer system is essential for ensuring operational safety, process transparency, and automation readiness. In many early-stage projects or documentation scenarios, engineers need a textual representation of the control diagram when graphical tools arenâ€™t available. Without a structured textual formatâ€”including piping, instrumentation, and interlocksâ€”it can be difficult to communicate control logic clearly across disciplines or trace compliance with standards.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a NORSOK-style System Control Diagram (SCD) using textual notation for a LNG vaporizer system. This diagram should:
	â€¢	Include major process elements (e.g., LNG feed lines, vaporizers, heaters, gas outlet)
	â€¢	Represent instrumentation and control loops with realistic tag numbers (e.g., TT101, FIC202, PSV301)
	â€¢	Clearly document interlocks (e.g., pressure high-high trip, ESD logic)
	â€¢	Indicate piping flow using arrows (-->) and group control functions logically (e.g., temperature control loop, flow regulation, safety shutdowns)

The result will be a functional, plain-text SCD layout that can support control system development and safety verification.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define process flow from LNG inlet â†’ vaporizer â†’ pressure regulation â†’ gas outlet.
	2.	Assign and place instrumentation:
	â€¢	Temperature loop: TT101 â†’ TIC101 â†’ Heater Control Valve (TCV101)
	â€¢	Flow loop: FT201 â†’ FIC201 â†’ FCV201
	â€¢	Safety: PSH301 (Pressure Switch High) â†’ ESD1
	3.	Use NORSOK-style loop and tag conventions (e.g., P&ID cross-references like U-610, L-120).
	4.	Format in readable text with logical grouping and indentation. Example:

 LNG Inlet --> FT201 --> FIC201 --> FCV201 --> Vaporizer
                                       |
                                       --> TT101 --> TIC101 --> TCV101
                                               |
                                               --> PSH301 --> ESD1
