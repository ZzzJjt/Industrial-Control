**IO List Steam Water Cycle:**

Create an I/O list as a table for feedwater control in a steam-water cycle in a power plant. Have as columns names, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In a steam-water cycle within a power plant, especially for feedwater control, precise monitoring and actuation of key parameters like flow, pressure, and level are essential. Without a structured I/O list, engineers face difficulties in aligning instrumentation, control logic, and P&ID referencesâ€”leading to integration delays, commissioning errors, or operational risks.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Create a comprehensive I/O list table tailored for feedwater control in a steam-water cycle. The table should include key control and monitoring signals and contain the following columns:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Signal Tag Number
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference

This I/O list should serve as a reliable reference for instrument selection, PLC/HMI configuration, and process documentation.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Identify typical feedwater control signals such as:
	â€¢	Feedwater flow transmitter
	â€¢	Drum level sensor
	â€¢	Feedwater control valve position
	â€¢	Pump status
	2.	For each signal, assign a unique tag, determine whether itâ€™s analog or digital, specify the unit (e.g., kg/h, %, bar), and define ranges and setpoints based on typical plant parameters.
	3.	Link each signal to its corresponding P&ID reference to maintain traceability across design documents.
	4.	Present the result as a clean, structured table that can be used across engineering, commissioning, and operational teams.
