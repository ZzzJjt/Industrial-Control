**Control Narrative Beer Brewing:**

Create a control narrative for beer brewing including concrete setpoints and ranges.

Create a detailed explanation of the Lautering process (Section 4). Include the equipment and instrumentation needed. Provide a list of the steps to execute.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In brewery automation projects, engineers often lack standardized documentation for complex processes like beer brewing. Without a well-structured control narrative, itâ€™s difficult to define setpoints, control logic, and instrumentation for each phaseâ€”especially for stages like lautering, which involve precise timing, flow control, and mechanical coordination. Inconsistent or vague narratives can lead to inefficiencies or errors during automation design or commissioning.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a comprehensive control narrative for the beer brewing process, including:
	â€¢	Clear setpoints and acceptable operating ranges for key parameters (e.g., temperature, flow, timing)
	â€¢	A focused explanation of the lautering process (Section 4), covering:
	â€¢	Required equipment and instrumentation (e.g., lauter tun, rake system, flow transmitters)
	â€¢	Step-by-step procedure for lautering
	â€¢	Relevant automation logic or decision conditions

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Begin by outlining the overall brewing process with specific control points, such as:
	â€¢	Mash temperature: 65â€“68â€¯Â°C
	â€¢	Sparge water temperature: 75â€“78â€¯Â°C
	â€¢	Lautering flow rate: 1.5â€“2.0 L/min
	â€¢	Holding tank level: 50â€“80%
	2.	In Section 4 (Lautering):
	â€¢	Describe the physical components: lauter tun, rake motor, underlet system, flowmeters
	â€¢	List instrumentation: temperature sensors, turbidity sensors, level transmitters
	â€¢	Step-by-step control logic, including:
	â€¢	Rake arm position control
	â€¢	Flow ramp-up sequence
	â€¢	Turbidity-based decision to stop lautering
	3.	Include control logic like:
	â€¢	IF turbidity > threshold THEN divert flow to waste
	â€¢	IF level < min THEN stop sparge water
	4.	Use structured formatting and bullet points or numbered steps for clarity
