**Feedforward Control Conveyor:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for adjusting the speed of a conveyor belt based on sensor-predicted load changes. The program should use input from sensors that predict the weight or volume of material entering the conveyor system, allowing for real-time adjustments to the belt speed before a load change occurs.

Include logic that calculates the required conveyor speed based on the predicted load and adjusts the motor speed accordingly, ensuring that the conveyor operates efficiently without overloading or underloading. Discuss the benefits of feedforward control in conveyor systems, particularly in reducing delays and improving response times compared to feedback-only control strategies.


**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Challenge

Traditional conveyor control systems that rely solely on feedback (e.g., reacting to speed errors or motor load) often respond too late to sudden load changes. This can result in material jams, underutilized capacity, or excessive wear due to abrupt motor adjustments. Predicting load changes ahead of time and acting proactively is essential for smoother, more efficient operation—especially in high-throughput or variable-load environments.

🟩 A (After) – The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) that:
	•	Implements feedforward control by reading real-time data from upstream sensors (e.g., weight or volume prediction).
	•	Calculates the required conveyor speed based on the predicted load using a tunable feedforward coefficient.
	•	Adjusts the motor speed preemptively, maintaining efficient throughput and avoiding overload or starvation.
	•	Enhances system stability and responsiveness, outperforming traditional feedback-only approaches in dynamic environments.

🟧 B (Bridge) – The Implementation Strategy

The program should follow this structure:
VAR
    // Input from load prediction sensors
    Predicted_Load : REAL;        // kg or volume units
    Base_Speed : REAL := 1.0;     // m/s, default/minimum conveyor speed
    Max_Load : REAL := 100.0;     // Max expected load (kg)
    
    // Feedforward coefficient
    Gain_FF : REAL := 0.02;       // Speed increase per unit load

    // Output to motor
    Conveyor_Speed : REAL;
END_VAR

// Calculate speed adjustment based on predicted load
Conveyor_Speed := Base_Speed + Gain_FF * Predicted_Load;

// Clamp conveyor speed to prevent over-speeding (optional)
IF Conveyor_Speed > 2.0 THEN
    Conveyor_Speed := 2.0;
ELSIF Conveyor_Speed < 0.5 THEN
    Conveyor_Speed := 0.5;
END_IF

// Conveyor_Speed is sent to motor controller
This code allows:
	•	Proactive speed control based on anticipated load
	•	Better throughput and system longevity
	•	Integration with existing feedback control loops for hybrid strategies
