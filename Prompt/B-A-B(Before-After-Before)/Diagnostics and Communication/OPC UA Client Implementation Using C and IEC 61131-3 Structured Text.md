**OPC UA Client Implementation Using C and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop C-code for an OPC UA client, then wrap it into an IEC 61131-based function block written in structured text (ST). The function block should have the following input pins: Execute (type: BOOL), ServerUrl (type: STRING[255]), and Timeout (type: TIME). The output pins should include Done (type: BOOL), Busy (type: BOOL), Error (type: BOOL), and ErrorID (type: DWORD). In your explanation, describe how the C-code interfaces with the OPC UA server, how the function block manages communication with the server, and how error handling is implemented. Provide details on how to integrate this function block within an IEC 61131-3 environment for reliable client-server communication.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

Integrating OPC UA client functionality into PLCs using IEC 61131-3 is complex due to differences in system-level communication APIs and the need for real-time responsiveness. Many control systems lack a seamless way to initiate and manage OPC UA connections from within Structured Text (ST), and often struggle with error propagation and execution state management across the C/IEC 61131 boundary.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop C-code that acts as an OPC UA client capable of establishing secure, timed connections with a specified server. Then, encapsulate this logic in a reusable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block with clearly defined input and output pins:
Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL): Initiates the OPC UA connection
	â€¢	ServerUrl (STRING[255]): Specifies the server address
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME): Defines the maximum wait duration for a connection

Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL): Indicates successful completion
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL): Indicates ongoing execution
	â€¢	Error (BOOL): Indicates a failure occurred
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD): Returns the specific error code

This function block enables PLCs to interface with OPC UA servers reliably while handling connection lifecycle and diagnostics internally.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

First, write C-code using a standard OPC UA client library (e.g., open62541) that handles the core connection logicâ€”resolving the server URL, establishing a session, sending requests, and managing timeouts or disconnects.
Next, wrap this C-code into a callable system function accessible from ST using a vendor-specific interface (e.g., dynamic library or external module reference).
Then, create an ST function block that invokes the C-code via this interface, tracking execution state (Busy), success (Done), and failure (Error, ErrorID) based on return values and timeouts.

Finally, provide usage guidelines for integrating the block in a PLC projectâ€”ensuring cyclic call patterns, rising edge detection on Execute, and monitoring of state outputs for safe, predictable control logic.
