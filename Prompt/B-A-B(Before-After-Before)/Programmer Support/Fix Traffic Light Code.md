**Fix Traffic Light Code:**

Can you find the error in the following 61131-3 ST code: PROGRAM TrafficLightControl VAR pedestrianButtonPressed: BOOL; emergencyVehicleApproaching: BOOL; greenLightOn: BOOL; yellowLightOn: BOOL; redLightOn: BOOL; timer: TON; // timer to control the duration of green and yellow lights END_VAR

// Initialize the program greenLightOn := TRUE; yellowLightOn := FALSE; redLightOn := FALSE; timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching, PT := T#5s);

// Main program loop WHILE TRUE DO // Check for pedestrian button press pedestrianButtonPressed := ReadPedestrianButton();

// Check for emergency vehicle approaching
emergencyVehicleApproaching := ReadEmergencyVehicleSensor();

IF emergencyVehicleApproaching THEN
    // Turn off all lights and turn on green light for emergency vehicle
    greenLightOn := TRUE;
    yellowLightOn := FALSE;
    redLightOn := FALSE;
    timer(IN := FALSE);

ELSEIF pedestrianButtonPressed THEN
    // Turn off all lights and turn on red light and pedestrian light
    greenLightOn := FALSE;
    yellowLightOn := FALSE;
    redLightOn := TRUE;
    timer(IN := FALSE);

    // Wait for pedestrian to cross
    WAIT UNTIL NOT pedestrianButtonPressed;

    // Turn on yellow light for warning and start the timer
    yellowLightOn := TRUE;
    redLightOn := FALSE;
    timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching);

ELSE
    // Check the timer and switch to the next light if it's time
    IF timer.Q THEN
        IF greenLightOn THEN
            greenLightOn := FALSE;
            yellowLightOn := TRUE;
            timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching);

        ELSEIF yellowLightOn THEN
            yellowLightOn := FALSE;
            redLightOn := TRUE;
            timer(IN := FALSE);

        ELSE // red light is on
            redLightOn := FALSE;
            greenLightOn := TRUE;
            timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching);
        END_IF;
    END_IF;
END_IF;

// Set the traffic lights based on the variables
SetTrafficLights(greenLightOn, yellowLightOn, redLightOn);

// Wait for a short time before checking again

**B-A-B:**

🟥 Before – The Problem or Context

You’re working with a 61131-3 Structured Text program to control a traffic light system that must respond to pedestrian button presses and emergency vehicle detection. However, the logic has several flaws that can cause:
	•	Unexpected light transitions
	•	Timer behavior that’s inconsistent
	•	Overlapping or unsafe light states
	•	Logical conflicts in the emergency and pedestrian handling

Your task is to identify and fix these issues to ensure the traffic light behaves safely and predictably under all scenarios.

⸻

🟩 After – The Fixed, Improved Outcome

The corrected code will:
	•	Properly initialize the timer and control its lifecycle
	•	Avoid overwriting light states multiple times in the same cycle
	•	Ensure pedestrian and emergency modes are handled mutually exclusively and return to normal operation cleanly
	•	Use the TON timer correctly (declaring .ET and .Q, handling .IN carefully)
	•	Remove unsafe constructs like WHILE TRUE DO and WAIT UNTIL which are not IEC-compliant in cyclic PLC scan models

⸻

🟦 Bridge – Explanation and Fix Suggestions

🔧 Problems in the original code:
	1.	Infinite WHILE TRUE loop blocks the main PLC scan cycle – this structure is not cyclic-friendly.
	2.	WAIT UNTIL NOT pedestrianButtonPressed; – not a valid Structured Text construct in most IEC 61131-3 PLCs.
	3.	The timer instance is reinitialized multiple times in one cycle → this can invalidate timing logic.
	4.	SetTrafficLights(...) is called every cycle, even if no change occurred.
	5.	No state machine is used – leading to unreadable and fragile control flow.

✅ Suggested Fixes:
	•	Implement a state machine (e.g., enum type: NORMAL, TO_YELLOW, TO_RED, PEDESTRIAN, EMERGENCY)
	•	Trigger transitions using flags and timer expiration
	•	Use R_TRIG for rising edge detection (e.g., pedestrian button press)
	•	Properly manage the timer: only change .IN when starting/stopping the phase
