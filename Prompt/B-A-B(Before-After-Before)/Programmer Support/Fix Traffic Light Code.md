**Fix Traffic Light Code:**

Can you find the error in the following 61131-3 ST code: PROGRAM TrafficLightControl VAR pedestrianButtonPressed: BOOL; emergencyVehicleApproaching: BOOL; greenLightOn: BOOL; yellowLightOn: BOOL; redLightOn: BOOL; timer: TON; // timer to control the duration of green and yellow lights END_VAR

// Initialize the program greenLightOn := TRUE; yellowLightOn := FALSE; redLightOn := FALSE; timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching, PT := T#5s);

// Main program loop WHILE TRUE DO // Check for pedestrian button press pedestrianButtonPressed := ReadPedestrianButton();

// Check for emergency vehicle approaching
emergencyVehicleApproaching := ReadEmergencyVehicleSensor();

IF emergencyVehicleApproaching THEN
    // Turn off all lights and turn on green light for emergency vehicle
    greenLightOn := TRUE;
    yellowLightOn := FALSE;
    redLightOn := FALSE;
    timer(IN := FALSE);

ELSEIF pedestrianButtonPressed THEN
    // Turn off all lights and turn on red light and pedestrian light
    greenLightOn := FALSE;
    yellowLightOn := FALSE;
    redLightOn := TRUE;
    timer(IN := FALSE);

    // Wait for pedestrian to cross
    WAIT UNTIL NOT pedestrianButtonPressed;

    // Turn on yellow light for warning and start the timer
    yellowLightOn := TRUE;
    redLightOn := FALSE;
    timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching);

ELSE
    // Check the timer and switch to the next light if it's time
    IF timer.Q THEN
        IF greenLightOn THEN
            greenLightOn := FALSE;
            yellowLightOn := TRUE;
            timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching);

        ELSEIF yellowLightOn THEN
            yellowLightOn := FALSE;
            redLightOn := TRUE;
            timer(IN := FALSE);

        ELSE // red light is on
            redLightOn := FALSE;
            greenLightOn := TRUE;
            timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching);
        END_IF;
    END_IF;
END_IF;

// Set the traffic lights based on the variables
SetTrafficLights(greenLightOn, yellowLightOn, redLightOn);

// Wait for a short time before checking again
DELAY 100ms;

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Before â€“ The Problem or Context

Youâ€™re working with a 61131-3 Structured Text program to control a traffic light system that must respond to pedestrian button presses and emergency vehicle detection. However, the logic has several flaws that can cause:
	â€¢	Unexpected light transitions
	â€¢	Timer behavior thatâ€™s inconsistent
	â€¢	Overlapping or unsafe light states
	â€¢	Logical conflicts in the emergency and pedestrian handling

Your task is to identify and fix these issues to ensure the traffic light behaves safely and predictably under all scenarios.

ðŸŸ© After â€“ The Fixed, Improved Outcome

The corrected code will:
	â€¢	Properly initialize the timer and control its lifecycle
	â€¢	Avoid overwriting light states multiple times in the same cycle
	â€¢	Ensure pedestrian and emergency modes are handled mutually exclusively and return to normal operation cleanly
	â€¢	Use the TON timer correctly (declaring .ET and .Q, handling .IN carefully)
	â€¢	Remove unsafe constructs like WHILE TRUE DO and WAIT UNTIL which are not IEC-compliant in cyclic PLC scan models

ðŸŸ¦ Bridge â€“ Explanation and Fix Suggestions

ðŸ”§ Problems in the original code:
	1.	Infinite WHILE TRUE loop blocks the main PLC scan cycle â€“ this structure is not cyclic-friendly.
	2.	WAIT UNTIL NOT pedestrianButtonPressed; â€“ not a valid Structured Text construct in most IEC 61131-3 PLCs.
	3.	The timer instance is reinitialized multiple times in one cycle â†’ this can invalidate timing logic.
	4.	SetTrafficLights(...) is called every cycle, even if no change occurred.
	5.	No state machine is used â€“ leading to unreadable and fragile control flow.

âœ… Suggested Fixes:
	â€¢	Implement a state machine (e.g., enum type: NORMAL, TO_YELLOW, TO_RED, PEDESTRIAN, EMERGENCY)
	â€¢	Trigger transitions using flags and timer expiration
	â€¢	Use R_TRIG for rising edge detection (e.g., pedestrian button press)
	â€¢	Properly manage the timer: only change .IN when starting/stopping the phase
