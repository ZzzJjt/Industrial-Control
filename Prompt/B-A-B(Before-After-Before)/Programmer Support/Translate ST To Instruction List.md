**Translate ST To Instruction List:**

Translate the following 61131-3 Structured Text program to 61131-3 Instruction List: PROGRAM PickAndPlace VAR ManualButton : BOOL; // Input signal for manual mode AutoButton : BOOL; // Input signal for auto mode ClipButton : BOOL; // Input signal for clip action TransferButton : BOOL; // Input signal for transfer action ReleaseButton : BOOL; // Input signal for release action ConveyorA : BOOL; // Input signal for presence of product on conveyor A ConveyorB : BOOL; // Output signal to control conveyor B RoboticArm : BOOL; // Output signal to control the robotic arm Mode : INT := 0; // Internal variable to store the current mode (0 = manual, 1 = auto) AutoProcess : BOOL := FALSE; // Internal variable to store whether the auto control process is currently running END_VAR

// Manual mode control process IF ManualButton THEN Mode := 0; // Set mode to manual END_IF

IF Mode = 0 THEN // Manual mode IF ClipButton AND ConveyorA THEN RoboticArm := TRUE; // Clip the product ELSIF TransferButton THEN ConveyorB := TRUE; // Transfer the product to conveyor B ELSIF ReleaseButton THEN ConveyorB := FALSE; // Release the product from conveyor B END_IF END_IF

// Auto mode control process IF AutoButton THEN Mode := 1; // Set mode to auto END_IF

IF Mode = 1 THEN // Auto mode IF NOT AutoProcess AND ConveyorA THEN // Only start the process if not currently running and there is a product on conveyor A AutoProcess := TRUE; // Set flag to indicate that the auto process is running RoboticArm := TRUE; // Clip the product WAIT 2; // Wait for 2 seconds to transfer the product ConveyorB := TRUE; // Transfer the product to conveyor B END_IF IF ConveyorB AND NOT ConveyorA THEN // Release the product from conveyor B once it has been transferred and there is no product on conveyor A ConveyorB := FALSE; AutoProcess := FALSE; // Clear the flag to indicate that the auto process is not running END_IF END_IF

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In IEC 61131-3 programming, engineers may need to convert between different textual languages depending on the target PLC platform or system requirements. One such common task is translating a program written in Structured Text (ST) into Instruction List (IL), which can be more suitable for low-level PLC execution but harder to manually convert due to differences in syntax and logic structure.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Translate a given Structured Text (ST) program into its equivalent representation using 61131-3 Instruction List (IL), preserving all logic, variable usage, and control flow. The resulting IL code should be logically accurate and syntactically compliant with the IEC 61131-3 standard, ready for execution on IL-compatible PLCs.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There

Take the provided ST program titled PickAndPlace, which includes manual and automatic control modes for a robotic arm and conveyor system. Break down each control structureâ€”such as conditional branches and state flagsâ€”and reimplement them in IL using appropriate instructions like LD, AND, ST, JMPC, JMP, and timers. Ensure proper handling of mode switching, auto-process flags, and signal transitions with exact logical equivalence.
