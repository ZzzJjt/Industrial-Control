**Object-oriented 61131-3:**
Discuss the concept of classes and methods introduced in IEC 61131-3 Version 3.0, including a detailed explanation of their limitations, advantages, and disadvantages in the context of industrial automation. Provide a relevant example to illustrate these concepts in practice.

Explain how inheritance is implemented in IEC 61131-3, building on the previous example to show how derived classes can extend base functionality. Additionally, refine the example further to demonstrate polymorphism within this framework, discussing its practical applications and constraints.

**B-A-B:**

🟥 Before – The Starting Point

Traditionally, IEC 61131-3 has been known for its procedural programming paradigm, widely used in industrial automation. While effective for many control tasks, Version 2.0 lacked modern programming constructs like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it harder to modularize and reuse code across complex systems.

🟩 After – The Desired Outcome

With the introduction of IEC 61131-3 Version 3.0, developers can now leverage object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as:
	•	Classes and methods to encapsulate logic
	•	Inheritance to create reusable and extendable components
	•	Polymorphism to generalize control behavior and simplify integration

You will provide:
	•	A clear explanation of how classes and methods are defined and used in IEC 61131-3
	•	A realistic example (e.g., a base class for a generic actuator and a subclass for a specific type)
	•	A discussion of the benefits and limitations of using OOP in PLCs
	•	An extension of the example to illustrate inheritance and then further to demonstrate polymorphism
	•	A reflection on the practical constraints of using these OOP features in industrial environments (e.g., scan cycle management, memory use, debugging)

🟦 Bridge – How to Get There

To bridge the procedural-to-OOP transition:
	1.	Start with an overview of the structural enhancements introduced in IEC 61131-3 Version 3.0.
	2.	Define a simple class structure, showing encapsulation through methods and variables.
	3.	Build on this to show how inheritance allows one function block (e.g., ValveController) to extend another (e.g., Actuator).
	4.	Then, demonstrate polymorphism, such as calling a method like Start() from a base class interface, but executing subclass-specific behavior.
	5.	Conclude with a thoughtful evaluation: when and why to use these features—and when not to—in the context of real-time industrial automation.
