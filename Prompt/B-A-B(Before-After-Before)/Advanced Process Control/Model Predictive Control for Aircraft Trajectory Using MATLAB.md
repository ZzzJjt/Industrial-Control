**Model Predictive Control for Aircraft Trajectory Using MATLAB:**

Develop MATLAB code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the trajectory of an aircraft. Ensure that the control scheme accounts for dynamic constraints, fuel efficiency, and external disturbances, while maintaining flight safety and performance objectives.

**B-A-B:**

ðŸŸ¥ Bï¼ˆBeforeï¼‰

Aircraft trajectory planning involves complex dynamics, strict safety requirements, and numerous real-world constraints such as fuel efficiency and environmental disturbances. Traditional control strategies often fall short in simultaneously handling these competing demands in real time.

ðŸŸ© Aï¼ˆAfterï¼‰

Develop MATLAB code that implements a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm capable of optimizing an aircraftâ€™s trajectory in real time. The controller should intelligently handle dynamic constraints, enhance fuel efficiency, mitigate external disturbances, and maintain compliance with safety and performance standards.

ðŸŸ§ Bï¼ˆBridgeï¼‰

Use MATLAB to build a dynamic model of aircraft motion, integrate it with an MPC formulation, and encode constraints and performance objectives. Simulate various flight scenarios to demonstrate how the MPC system maintains optimal trajectories even under changing environmental and operational conditions.
