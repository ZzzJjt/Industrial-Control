**Matrix Multiplication:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 to perform multiplication of two 4x4 matrices. Ensure that the implementation adheres to the standards of structured text programming and includes detailed comments explaining each part of the process. Discuss the computational complexity and potential limitations when scaling this approach to larger matrices.

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Challenge

Matrix operations such as multiplication are fundamental in robotics, motion control, and signal processing. However, PLC platforms using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text typically lack built-in matrix support and are constrained by limited memory, scan-time budgets, and loop processing speed. Without a structured, reusable function block, engineers often resort to repetitive, error-prone manual calculations or external systems.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Ideal Outcome

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block, named MatrixMultiply4x4, that:
	â€¢	Multiplies two 4x4 matrices:
	â€¢	Inputs: MatrixA, MatrixB of type ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL
	â€¢	Output: MatrixC of the same type containing the result
	â€¢	Uses standard triple nested FOR loops to perform matrix multiplication
	â€¢	Includes detailed inline comments explaining each index operation and calculation:
// Multiply row i of MatrixA by column j of MatrixB
// Sum the products to compute MatrixC[i, j]
	â€¢	Follows IEC 61131-3 structured text conventions for readability and portability
	â€¢	Ensures modular design so the block can be reused in motion algorithms, coordinate transformations, or control systems

Also, discuss the computational complexity of the algorithm (O(nÂ³) for nÃ—n matrices) and the performance trade-offs when scaling to larger matrices, particularly on PLCs with limited processing speed and memory.

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ The Implementation Strategy

To implement this solution:
	1.	Declare the function block with input/output matrix variables:

 FUNCTION_BLOCK MatrixMultiply4x4
VAR_INPUT
    MatrixA, MatrixB : ARRAY[1..4,1..4] OF REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    MatrixC : ARRAY[1..4,1..4] OF REAL;
END_VAR
	2.	Use triple FOR loops to perform multiplication:
 FOR i := 1 TO 4 DO
    FOR j := 1 TO 4 DO
        MatrixC[i,j] := 0;
        FOR k := 1 TO 4 DO
            MatrixC[i,j] := MatrixC[i,j] + MatrixA[i,k] * MatrixB[k,j];
        END_FOR;
    END_FOR;
END_FOR;
	3.	Comment each major step and ensure the code adheres to deterministic execution suitable for PLC environments.
	4.	In the documentation, highlight that while this method works well for small matrices (e.g., 2x2 to 4x4), it becomes less efficient and potentially scan-time-prohibitive for larger dimensions without hardware acceleration or segmentation.
