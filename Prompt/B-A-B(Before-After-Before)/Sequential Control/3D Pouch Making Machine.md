**3D Pouch Making Machine:**

Design a detailed start-up and shutdown sequence for a 3D pouch making machine in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The machine consists of 8 heating stations, 8 cooling stations, one horizontal cutter, one vertical cutter, and two feeder units responsible for raw material feeding. Winding tension management is critical throughout the process to ensure proper tension in the raw material.

Write a structured start-up sequence that sequentially activates the heating and cooling stations, regulates the feeder units to maintain optimal tension, and ensures proper synchronization between the cutters and material flow. Additionally, create a shutdown sequence that safely deactivates each component in the correct order, ensuring proper cooling and tension release.

Ensure the program includes typical parameter values, timers, and conditions for each stage of the start-up and shutdown procedures, and discuss the importance of winding tension in maintaining machine efficiency and product quality.

**B-A-B:**

🟥 B (Before) – The Problem or Challenge

A 3D pouch making machine involves multiple interdependent components—including heating and cooling stations, cutters, and feeders—that must operate in a precise, coordinated sequence. Without proper start-up and shutdown procedures, there is a risk of equipment damage, poor product quality, or inconsistent material tension, especially given the critical role of winding tension in maintaining raw material stability.

🟩 A (After) – The Desired Outcome

Design a reliable IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that handles both start-up and shutdown sequences for the 3D pouch making machine. The program should sequentially control all components—activating heaters and coolers, managing feeder units to maintain winding tension, and synchronizing horizontal and vertical cutters with material flow. It should also ensure safe deactivation of each part during shutdown, incorporating necessary delays, parameter checks, and tension release logic.

🟧 B (Bridge) – How to Get There

Write a complete control sequence using Structured Text that includes:
	•	Step-by-step start-up logic with interlocks, timers, and parameter thresholds (e.g., preheat times, cooling stages).
	•	Real-time winding tension regulation via controlled feeder operation.
	•	Synchronized cutter activation once flow and tension conditions are met.
	•	An orderly shutdown process that ensures cooling, tension release, and safe cutter disengagement.
Include code comments and discussion on how each step contributes to maintaining machine efficiency and final pouch quality, emphasizing why proper winding tension is essential to avoid defects or misalignment.
