**Real Comparator:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to compare two real inputs up to n decimal places. Include configurable precision and error handling.

ðŸŸ¥ B (Before) â€“ The Problem or Challenge

In many industrial control systems, comparing floating-point values (REAL types) directly can lead to unreliable results due to rounding errors and floating-point representation limits. Without a method to compare numbers with a specified decimal precision, engineers may encounter false mismatches or unstable logic in process comparisons, alarming, or control switching logic.

ðŸŸ© A (After) â€“ The Desired Outcome

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text that compares two REAL inputs up to n decimal places. The function block should:
	â€¢	Accept a user-defined precision level (n)
	â€¢	Normalize or round both input values to that precision before comparison
	â€¢	Provide output flags such as Equal, Greater, and Less
	â€¢	Handle floating-point inaccuracies and include error checks (e.g., invalid precision or input range)

ðŸŸ§ B (Bridge) â€“ How to Get There
	1.	Define the function block with inputs:
	â€¢	Input1 : REAL, Input2 : REAL
	â€¢	Precision : INT (number of decimal places to compare)
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL
	2.	Internally calculate a scaling factor based on precision:
\text{Scale} := 10^\text{Precision}
Then compare ROUND(Input1 * Scale) vs ROUND(Input2 * Scale)
	3.	Provide outputs:
	â€¢	Equal : BOOL
	â€¢	Greater : BOOL
	â€¢	Less : BOOL
	â€¢	Error : BOOL (e.g., if Precision < 0 or inputs are invalid)
	4.	Include inline comments and safeguards to ensure scan-cycle-safe operation and clarity
