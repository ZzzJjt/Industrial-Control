**Counter:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text for a digital counter with up/down counting modes. Include configurable initial value, step size, and overflow handling.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC developer creating a flexible, reusable digital counter function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for automation applications.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Implement a self-contained counter function block that supports both up and down counting modes with the following features:
	â€¢	A configurable initial value and step size
	â€¢	Inputs for count direction, enable, and reset
	â€¢	Protection against overflow and underflow, using configurable MaxValue and MinValue limits
	â€¢	Output of the current count value and status flags indicating if limits are reached

The counter should operate reliably in scan-cycle-driven environments and support integration into larger automation programs.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide:
	â€¢	A complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block
	â€¢	Declarations for all inputs, outputs, and internal variables
	â€¢	Logic using IF/ELSIF structures to increment/decrement the counter
	â€¢	Overflow and underflow handling using comparison conditions
	â€¢	A Reset condition to reinitialize the counter
	â€¢	Inline comments explaining the purpose of each block of code
