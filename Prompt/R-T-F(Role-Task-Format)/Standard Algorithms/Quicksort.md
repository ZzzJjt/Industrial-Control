**Quicksort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. Ensure efficient partitioning and recursion handling.

**R-T-F:**

🟥 R (Role) – Define Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer creating a robust, scan-safe quicksort function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for industrial control systems.

⸻

🟩 T (Task) – Define the Objective

Design and implement a self-contained function block that performs the quicksort algorithm on an array of integers. Your implementation must:
	•	Sort the array in place
	•	Replace recursive calls with iterative logic using a manually managed stack
	•	Use an efficient partitioning method (such as Lomuto or Hoare)
	•	Be modular, reusable, and compatible with PLC scan cycles
	•	Include clear status handling with Execute, Busy, and Done flags
	•	Prevent runtime issues such as stack overflows or memory errors

⸻

🟧 F (Format) – Specify the Output Format

Provide a complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block with:
	•	Inputs:
	•	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	•	Execute : BOOL
	•	Outputs:
	•	SortedArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT (optional)
	•	Done : BOOL
	•	Busy : BOOL
	•	Internal components:
	•	Stack simulation using LowStack, HighStack arrays
	•	Variables for Pivot, i, j, and temporary swap buffer
	•	Iterative loop to simulate quicksort recursion
	•	Inline comments explaining:
	•	Stack operations
	•	Subarray bounds management
	•	Partitioning logic
