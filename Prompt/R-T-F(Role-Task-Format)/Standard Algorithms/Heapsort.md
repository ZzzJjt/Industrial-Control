**Heapsort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the heapsort algorithm on an array of integers without using recursion or the â€˜DOWNTOâ€™ keyword in loops. Ensure efficient heap construction and sorting.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems programmer implementing IEC 61131-3 Structured Text algorithms for efficient, standards-compliant sorting within programmable logic controllers (PLCs).

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Develop a self-contained function block to implement the heapsort algorithm on an array of integers. The solution must:
	â€¢	Avoid recursion to ensure compatibility with PLC scan-cycle execution
	â€¢	Not use the DOWNTO keyword, relying instead on ascending index logic
	â€¢	Efficiently construct a max heap using iterative loops
	â€¢	Sort the array in-place for memory efficiency
	â€¢	Be robust, reusable, and well-documented for industrial applications

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide a complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block with:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	â€¢	Execute : BOOL
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	SortedArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT (optional if sorting in-place)
	â€¢	Done : BOOL

Include:
	â€¢	An iterative heapify routine
	â€¢	Heap construction loop using ascending indexing
	â€¢	Sorting phase logic with controlled swaps and heap reduction
	â€¢	Inline comments explaining the heap logic, array access, and execution phases
