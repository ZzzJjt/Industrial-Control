**Heapsort:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to perform the heapsort algorithm on an array of integers without using recursion or the ‘DOWNTO’ keyword in loops. Ensure efficient heap construction and sorting.

**R-T-F:**

🟥 R (Role) – Define Your Role

Act as a control systems programmer implementing IEC 61131-3 Structured Text algorithms for efficient, standards-compliant sorting within programmable logic controllers (PLCs).

⸻

🟩 T (Task) – Define the Objective

Develop a self-contained function block to implement the heapsort algorithm on an array of integers. The solution must:
	•	Avoid recursion to ensure compatibility with PLC scan-cycle execution
	•	Not use the DOWNTO keyword, relying instead on ascending index logic
	•	Efficiently construct a max heap using iterative loops
	•	Sort the array in-place for memory efficiency
	•	Be robust, reusable, and well-documented for industrial applications

⸻

🟧 F (Format) – Specify the Output Format

Provide a complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block with:
	•	Inputs:
	•	InputArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT
	•	Execute : BOOL
	•	Outputs:
	•	SortedArray : ARRAY[1..N] OF INT (optional if sorting in-place)
	•	Done : BOOL

Include:
	•	An iterative heapify routine
	•	Heap construction loop using ascending indexing
	•	Sorting phase logic with controlled swaps and heap reduction
	•	Inline comments explaining the heap logic, array access, and execution phases
