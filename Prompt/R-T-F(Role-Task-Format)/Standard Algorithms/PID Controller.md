**PID Controller:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a PID controller. Include configurable parameters for proportional, integral, and derivative gains, with error handling and tuning capability.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer designing a tunable PID controller in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for real-time industrial automation.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Develop a self-contained function block that implements a PID control algorithm. The block must:
	â€¢	Accept configurable gain inputs:
	â€¢	Kp (Proportional), Ki (Integral), Kd (Derivative)
	â€¢	Calculate the control error based on Setpoint and ProcessVariable
	â€¢	Include:
	â€¢	Integral windup protection (via clamping or conditional integration)
	â€¢	Derivative calculation using the rate of change in the process variable
	â€¢	Reset functionality to reinitialize internal states
	â€¢	Support output clamping with MinOutput and MaxOutput
	â€¢	Execute safely within one scan cycle
	â€¢	Be documented and modular for easy reuse

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide a complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block that includes:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	Setpoint : REAL, ProcessVariable : REAL
	â€¢	Kp, Ki, Kd : REAL
	â€¢	MinOutput, MaxOutput : REAL
	â€¢	Enable, Reset : BOOL
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	ControlOutput : REAL
	â€¢	Optionally: Error, IntegralTerm, DerivativeTerm for monitoring
	â€¢	Logic blocks:
	â€¢	Initialization section
	â€¢	PID calculation section (error, P/I/D terms)
	â€¢	Output limiting and anti-windup handling
	â€¢	State updates for the next scan
