**Kalman Filter:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to create a Kalman filter for estimating the position and velocity of an autonomous transport vehicle. Include configurable parameters for noise covariance and initial conditions.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC control engineer developing a Kalman filter in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for real-time state estimation in an autonomous vehicle control system.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Implement a self-contained Kalman filter function block that estimates the position and velocity of an autonomous transport vehicle using noisy position measurements. Your implementation should:
	â€¢	Use a simplified 2-state discrete-time Kalman filter
	â€¢	Accept configuration inputs for:
	â€¢	Process noise covariance (Q)
	â€¢	Measurement noise covariance (R)
	â€¢	Initial position and velocity
	â€¢	Sample time (DeltaT)
	â€¢	Be written entirely with scalar arithmetic (no recursion or matrix libraries)
	â€¢	Include input validation, reset capability, and internal memory for state tracking
	â€¢	Output the estimated position and velocity, as well as optional Kalman gain
	â€¢	Ensure safe execution in PLC scan-cycle environments
