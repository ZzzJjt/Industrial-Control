**IO List Rolling Mill:**

Create an I/O list as a table with 30 lines for a rolling mill in a steel production plant. Have as columns signal name, input/output, signal tagnumber, analog/digital, engineering unit, ranges, setpoint, and P&ID reference.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer responsible for creating detailed I/O documentation for the automation of a rolling mill in a steel production facility.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Generate a structured I/O list table containing 30 lines, each representing a control or monitoring signal relevant to the rolling mill process. Each row must include the following columns:
	â€¢	Signal Name
	â€¢	Input/Output
	â€¢	Signal Tagnumber
	â€¢	Analog/Digital
	â€¢	Engineering Unit
	â€¢	Range
	â€¢	Setpoint
	â€¢	P&ID Reference

The list should reflect realistic instrumentation, such as motor speed feedback, roll gap position, cooling valve control, hydraulic pressure, and strip tension.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide the output as a cleanly formatted table suitable for documentation, HMI/PLC configuration, or Excel import. The format should support:
	â€¢	Clear signal identification and traceability
	â€¢	Inclusion of engineering metadata (units, range, setpoints)
	â€¢	Cross-reference with P&ID diagrams for system integration
	â€¢	Compatibility with control logic implementation and commissioning workflows
