**Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Reactor**

Create a control narrative for a reactor producing ammonium nitrates including concrete setpoints and ranges.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

You are a chemical process control engineer responsible for drafting a control narrative for the ammonium nitrate reactor used in continuous production. Your narrative will support PLC/DCS programming and operator training.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You need to develop a control narrative that includes:
	â€¢	Setpoints and acceptable operating ranges for temperature, pressure, pH, and flow ratios
	â€¢	A list of required instrumentation and equipment, including sensors, valves, and controllers
	â€¢	Clear operational procedures: startup, steady-state control, shutdown
	â€¢	Defined control logic, including alarms, interlocks, and safety functions

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Identify key control parameters with setpoints and ranges:
	â€¢	Reactor temperature: 175â€¯Â°C Â± 2â€¯Â°C
	â€¢	Reactor pressure: 4.8â€¯bar Â± 0.2â€¯bar
	â€¢	Ammonia:nitric acid molar ratio: 1.01:1
	â€¢	Outlet pH: 6.2 Â± 0.3
	2.	List critical equipment and instrumentation:
	â€¢	TIC-101: Temperature control loop
	â€¢	PIC-102: Pressure control loop
	â€¢	FIC-103/FIC-104: Ammonia and acid flow controllers
	â€¢	AIC-105: Inline pH analyzer
	â€¢	ESD-106: Emergency shutdown valve
	3.	Define control procedures:
	â€¢	Startup: Ensure all control loops are in AUTO, initiate flow with ramp-up control, preheat reactor, verify level and pressure
	â€¢	Steady-state operation: Use ratio control between FIC-103 and FIC-104, monitor TIC-101 and PIC-102 with PID logic, adjust ammonia flow to maintain pH
	â€¢	Shutdown: Initiate safe ramp-down, isolate feeds, depressurize reactor, open vent paths as needed
	4.	Add interlocks and alarms:
	â€¢	ESD if temperature > 185â€¯Â°C or pressure > 5.2â€¯bar
	â€¢	Low-pH trip if pH < 5.5 sustained for >30 seconds
	â€¢	High-level switch disables acid feed if LSH-107 = TRUE

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a structured, detailed control narrative that:
	â€¢	Provides a clear operational guideline for reactor automation
	â€¢	Ensures safe, efficient, and regulatory-compliant ammonium nitrate production
	â€¢	Enables translation into ladder logic, function blocks, or ISA-88 control modules
	â€¢	Supports integration with alarm management and HMI/SCADA systems
