**Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Reactor**

Create a control narrative for a reactor producing ammonium nitrates including concrete setpoints and ranges.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a process control engineer developing a formal control narrative for a reactor producing ammonium nitrate, intended for automation system configuration, safety documentation, and operator reference.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Draft a control narrative that:
	â€¢	Describes the process purpose and operating principles of the ammonium nitrate reactor
	â€¢	Specifies key process parameters with setpoints and acceptable ranges (e.g., temperature, pressure, pH, flow ratios)
	â€¢	Details the required instrumentation and control equipment, including control loops (e.g., TIC, PIC, FIC), sensors, and valves
	â€¢	Outlines the sequence of operation for startup, normal operation, and shutdown
	â€¢	Includes interlock conditions and alarm logic to ensure safe and stable operation

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Structure the control narrative as follows:
	1.	Process Overview
	â€¢	Purpose: Neutralize nitric acid with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate
	â€¢	Reactor Type: Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR)
	â€¢	Normal flow conditions and operational limits
	2.	Key Setpoints and Ranges
	â€¢	Temperature (TIC-101): 175â€¯Â°C Â± 2â€¯Â°C
	â€¢	Pressure (PIC-102): 4.8â€¯bar Â± 0.2â€¯bar
	â€¢	Ammonia:Acid Ratio (FRC-103): 1.01:1
	â€¢	pH Control (AIC-105): Target = 6.2, acceptable range = 5.8â€“6.5
	3.	Instrumentation and Equipment
	â€¢	Flow transmitters (FIC-103, FIC-104), pH analyzer (AIC-105)
	â€¢	Safety interlocks: high-pressure switch, high-temperature alarm, emergency shutoff valve (ESD-106)
	4.	Sequence of Operation
	â€¢	Startup: Initialize controllers, ramp up feed flows, preheat reactor, activate ratio and pH control
	â€¢	Steady-State: Maintain PID loops, monitor deviation alarms, and log key values
	â€¢	Shutdown: Isolate feeds, depressurize, stop heating, drain reactor contents
	5.	Interlocks and Alarms
	â€¢	Temperature > 185â€¯Â°C â†’ emergency shutdown
	â€¢	Pressure > 5.2â€¯bar â†’ close feed valves
	â€¢	pH < 5.5 â†’ alarm + reduce ammonia flow
