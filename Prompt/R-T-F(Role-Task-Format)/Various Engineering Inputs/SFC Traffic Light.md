**SFC Traffic Light:**

Create a 61131-3 sequential function chart in ASCII art for a traffic light. Include proper delays for switching the lights.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer responsible for designing and documenting a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) for a traffic light system in compliance with IEC 61131-3.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Create an ASCII-based SFC diagram for a traffic light that includes:
	â€¢	Three sequential steps: Green, Yellow, and Red
	â€¢	A TON (on-delay) timer at each step to define its duration:
	â€¢	Green for 5 seconds
	â€¢	Yellow for 2 seconds
	â€¢	Red for 5 seconds
	â€¢	Transitions between steps based on each timerâ€™s .Q output
	â€¢	A clear loop that cycles continuously from Red back to Green

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Present the SFC in plain ASCII art, using:
	â€¢	Boxes or labels to represent steps
	â€¢	Arrows (-->) or downward flow to indicate transitions
	â€¢	Timer function blocks and conditions next to each step
	â€¢	Optional: clearly label the SFC loop to show full cycle logic

Example:

[Step: Green Light]
   TON tGreen (PT := T#5s)
        |
        V (tGreen.Q)
[Step: Yellow Light]
   TON tYellow (PT := T#2s)
        |
        V (tYellow.Q)
[Step: Red Light]
   TON tRed (PT := T#5s)
        |
        V (tRed.Q)
--> Loop to Green
