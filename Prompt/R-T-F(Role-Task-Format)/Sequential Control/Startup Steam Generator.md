**Startup Steam Generator:**

Develop a non-linear model-predictive controller (NMPC) in Python to optimize the startup process of a steam generator in a power plant. The NMPC should be designed to handle the non-linear dynamics of the steam generation process, considering key variables such as pressure, temperature, and flow rates. The controller must minimize startup time while maintaining safety and operational constraints.

Ensure that the Python implementation is modular, with clear explanations of the optimization algorithm, control horizon, and prediction model. Discuss the benefits of using NMPC for steam generator startup, particularly in terms of energy efficiency and system stability, and highlight the challenges associated with controlling such a complex non-linear process.
