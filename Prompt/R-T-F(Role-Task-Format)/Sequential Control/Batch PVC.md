**Batch PVC:**

Develop a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for the sequential control of a reactor in the batch production of polyvinylchloride (PVC) via polymerization of vinyl chloride monomers. The program should follow an ISA-88 control recipe structure and include the following process stages: polymerize, decover, and dry. Each stage should consist of ordered operations, including preparing the reactor by evacuating it to remove oxygen, charging the reactor with demineralized water and surfactants, and reacting by adding vinyl chloride monomer and catalyst while controlling the temperature between 55-60Â°C until the pressure decreases.

Provide detailed content for key methods such as EvacuateReactor, which should handle the removal of oxygen, and AddDemineralizedWater, ensuring precise process parameters and timers are integrated. Additionally, discuss the application of ISA-88 principles in structuring the control recipe and the challenges involved in scaling the recipe for industrial use.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer developing ISA-88-compliant batch control applications using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for chemical manufacturing.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Develop a self-contained Structured Text program to control a batch PVC production process using the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomers. The system must follow an ISA-88 control recipe structure and manage the following sequential stages:
	â€¢	Polymerize: Evacuate the reactor to remove oxygen, charge it with demineralized water and surfactants, and initiate polymerization by adding VCM and catalyst while maintaining the temperature at 55â€“60Â°C until pressure drops.
	â€¢	Decover: Prepare the reactor for depressurization or material removal.
	â€¢	Dry: Execute drying operations to remove residual moisture and finalize the product.

Include reusable, well-structured logic for key methods such as EvacuateReactor and AddDemineralizedWater, incorporating timers, process parameters, and safety interlocks.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide:
	â€¢	An IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program with modular code blocks following ISA-88 procedural and equipment models
	â€¢	Method implementations for each major operation with in-line comments
	â€¢	Use of variables for temperature, pressure, and time control
	â€¢	Clear logic transitions between phases (e.g., IF/CASE with timers and sensor conditions)
	â€¢	A brief note on how the structure supports scalability and industrial deployment
