**Shutdown Steel Production:**

Develop a comprehensive list of steps for the controlled shutdown of a steel production facility. Include key stages such as reducing furnace temperature, controlling gas flow rates, and maintaining safe oxygen levels throughout the shutdown process.

Provide a detailed control narrative for steps 4 to 6 of the shutdown sequence, specifying concrete ranges and setpoints for variables such as temperature, gas flow, and oxygen levels.

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program based on this control narrative, ensuring proper sequencing and safety protocols.

Additionally, create a function in IEC 61131-3 to gradually reduce the fuel gas flow rate to the furnace burners over a period of 12 hours. This function should incorporate timing and safety checks to ensure smooth transitions.

Lastly, write an IEC 61131-3 function for adjusting the oxygen supply to the burners to maintain a precise fuel-to-air ratio of 1:2.5 during the shutdown. Ensure the function is adaptable to fluctuations in gas flow and temperature, and include safeguards for maintaining combustion efficiency.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Develop a Structured Text-based shutdown program for a steel production facility. The task includes:
	â€¢	Creating a complete step-by-step shutdown sequence, covering essential phases such as furnace cooldown, gas flow reduction, and oxygen level management.
	â€¢	Writing a detailed control narrative for steps 4 to 6, including exact setpoints and timing requirements for variables like temperature, gas flow, and oxygen concentration.
	â€¢	Implementing a self-contained IEC 61131-3 program that handles the sequencing logic and enforces safety protocols.
	â€¢	Designing a function block to ramp down fuel gas flow over 12 hours, with safety checks and timer-based control.
	â€¢	Creating another function that adjusts oxygen supply to maintain a 1:2.5 fuel-to-air ratio, with adaptability to gas flow rate and furnace temperature changes.
