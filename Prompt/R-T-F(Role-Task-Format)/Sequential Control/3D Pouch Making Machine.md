**3D Pouch Making Machine:**

Design a detailed start-up and shutdown sequence for a 3D pouch making machine in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The machine consists of 8 heating stations, 8 cooling stations, one horizontal cutter, one vertical cutter, and two feeder units responsible for raw material feeding. Winding tension management is critical throughout the process to ensure proper tension in the raw material.

Write a structured start-up sequence that sequentially activates the heating and cooling stations, regulates the feeder units to maintain optimal tension, and ensures proper synchronization between the cutters and material flow. Additionally, create a shutdown sequence that safely deactivates each component in the correct order, ensuring proper cooling and tension release.

Ensure the program includes typical parameter values, timers, and conditions for each stage of the start-up and shutdown procedures, and discuss the importance of winding tension in maintaining machine efficiency and product quality.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a control systems engineer programming in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for advanced packaging machinery.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Design a detailed start-up and shutdown sequence in Structured Text for a 3D pouch making machine. The machine includes 8 heating stations, 8 cooling stations, a horizontal cutter, a vertical cutter, and two feeder units. Your program should manage:
	â€¢	Sequential activation and deactivation of all stations
	â€¢	Real-time winding tension control via feeder units
	â€¢	Synchronization between cutters and material flow
	â€¢	Safe shutdown procedures with proper cooling and tension release

Include timers, parameters, and conditions relevant to each step in the sequence.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Specify the Output Format

Provide a complete IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program with:
	â€¢	Clearly structured code blocks for start-up and shutdown
	â€¢	Descriptive variable names and parameter values (e.g., temperature thresholds, delay times)
	â€¢	In-line comments explaining each control step
	â€¢	Logical sequencing using IF/ELSIF statements, timers, and mode/state management variables
