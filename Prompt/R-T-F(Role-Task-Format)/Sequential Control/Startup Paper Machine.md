**Startup Paper Machine:**

Develop a detailed startup sequence for the press section of a Valmet paper machine, specifying typical parameter values such as press roll speed, nip pressure, and temperature settings. The sequence should include the step-by-step activation of the press section components, ensuring proper synchronization between the rolls and conveyors, and gradually ramping up to the operational speed.

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to control this startup sequence. The program should include logic for managing interlocks, safety checks, and smooth transitions between startup phases. Discuss the significance of maintaining optimal nip pressure and temperature throughout the process to prevent damage to the paper sheet and equipment.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as an automation engineer developing an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for the safe and efficient startup of the press section of a Valmet paper machine.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ Define the Objective

Design a detailed startup sequence for the press section that includes:
	â€¢	Sequential activation of press rolls and conveyors
	â€¢	Management of key parameters like:
	â€¢	Press roll speed (e.g., up to 500 m/min)
	â€¢	Nip pressure (e.g., ramp to 250 kN/m)
	â€¢	Temperature (e.g., 85â€“90Â°C)
	â€¢	Smooth ramp-up to operating speed
	â€¢	Integration of safety interlocks, timers, and logic for synchronized movement
	â€¢	Highlighting the importance of nip pressure and temperature stability to prevent equipment damage or sheet breakage

Additionally, implement a self-contained Structured Text program with clearly defined startup phases, safe transitions, and modular structure.
