**Eigenvalue:**

Design a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the eigenvalues of a 10x10 matrix. Ensure the function block is optimized for performance and includes detailed comments to explain the steps involved in the eigenvalue calculation. Discuss potential challenges related to numerical stability, convergence, and computational efficiency when implementing this algorithm in a PLC environment, particularly for real-time applications.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a control systems or PLC programmer tasked with implementing a mathematical function block capable of calculating eigenvalues from a 10Ã—10 matrix using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block named ComputeEigenvalues_10x10 that:
	â€¢	Accepts a REAL[10,10] matrix as input
	â€¢	Computes and returns its eigenvalues as a REAL[10] array
	â€¢	Implements a suitable eigenvalue estimation algorithm (e.g., Power Method or simplified QR iteration)
	â€¢	Includes detailed comments within the code to explain each step of the process
	â€¢	Optimizes execution for PLC performance, ensuring the algorithm runs efficiently within real-time constraints
	â€¢	Accounts for issues such as:
	â€¢	Numerical stability (e.g., normalization, underflow/overflow)
	â€¢	Convergence control (e.g., iteration limits, thresholds)
	â€¢	Fallback behavior in case of non-convergence or timeout

Additionally, describe how eigenvalue analysis is relevant in industrial applications such as system modeling, vibration detection, and control tuning.
