**Matrix Multiplication:**

Develop a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 to perform multiplication of two 4x4 matrices. Ensure that the implementation adheres to the standards of structured text programming and includes detailed comments explaining each part of the process. Discuss the computational complexity and potential limitations when scaling this approach to larger matrices.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer or automation engineer tasked with implementing mathematical operations on industrial controllers using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. Your goal is to enable efficient matrix computation for use in control logic, robotics, or motion coordination systems.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained function block named MatrixMultiply4x4 that:
	â€¢	Performs multiplication of two 4Ã—4 matrices
	â€¢	Accepts two inputs:
	â€¢	MatrixA: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL
	â€¢	MatrixB: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL
	â€¢	Returns:
	â€¢	MatrixC: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL, the resulting matrix product
	â€¢	Implements standard matrix multiplication logic using triple nested FOR loops
	â€¢	Includes detailed inline comments explaining each step of the multiplication process, including:
	â€¢	Iteration over rows and columns
	â€¢	Inner loop to compute dot products
	â€¢	Resetting the output element before summing products
	â€¢	Follows IEC 61131-3 structured text conventions for clarity, reusability, and compatibility
	â€¢	Discusses limitations:
	â€¢	Computational complexity: O(nÂ³), not scalable for large matrices on PLCs
	â€¢	Real-time constraints: impact of loop depth on scan cycle time
	â€¢	Memory usage: array-based implementation must be fixed and pre-sized

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Your deliverable should include:
	â€¢	A fully implemented IEC 61131-3 function block:

 FUNCTION_BLOCK MatrixMultiply4x4
VAR_INPUT
    MatrixA, MatrixB : ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    MatrixC : ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL;
END_VAR
VAR
    i, j, k : INT;
END_VAR

FOR i := 1 TO 4 DO
    FOR j := 1 TO 4 DO
        MatrixC[i,j] := 0;
        FOR k := 1 TO 4 DO
            MatrixC[i,j] := MatrixC[i,j] + MatrixA[i,k] * MatrixB[k,j];
        END_FOR;
    END_FOR;
END_FOR;
	â€¢	Commented explanation for each block of code
	â€¢	A short note on real-world applications, such as using the block to perform coordinate frame transformations or chaining 3D transformation matrices in robotic arms
