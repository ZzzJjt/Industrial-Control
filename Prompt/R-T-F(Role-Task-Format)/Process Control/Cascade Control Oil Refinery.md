**Cascade Control Oil Refinery:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement cascade control for pressure regulation in an oil refinery vessel. The primary loop should control the vessel pressure, adjusting the pressure setpoint based on the process requirements. The secondary loop controls the flow of oil into the vessel, with the output of the primary loop serving as the setpoint for the secondary loop.

Ensure that the program manages the interaction between the two control loops, allowing the inner loop (oil flow control) to respond rapidly to changes in flow while the outer loop (pressure control) maintains overall process stability. Include typical parameter values for pressure and flow control, and discuss the benefits of cascade control in oil refinery operations, particularly for improving response time and process stability in systems with large disturbances.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a control systems engineer responsible for developing an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to manage pressure regulation in an oil refinery vessel using cascade control architecture.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained Structured Text program (not a function block) that implements:
	1.	Cascade Control Structure:
	â€¢	Primary (outer) loop: Controls the vessel pressure by generating a flow setpoint.
	â€¢	Secondary (inner) loop: Controls the oil inflow rate using the flow setpoint from the outer loop.
	2.	Control Logic:
	â€¢	Use proportional control in both loops for simplicity.
	â€¢	Assign practical values:
	â€¢	Pressure setpoint: Pressure_SP := 12.0 (bar)
	â€¢	Gains: Kp_Outer := 1.2, Kp_Inner := 2.5
	3.	Execution Strategy:
	â€¢	The inner loop must respond faster than the outer loop to disturbances.
	â€¢	Ensure the program is structured, readable, and suitable for real-time PLC deployment.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

You should provide a clean, modular Structured Text code block like the following:
VAR
    // Outer loop (pressure control)
    Pressure_SP : REAL := 12.0;
    Pressure_PV : REAL;
    Pressure_Error : REAL;
    Flow_SP : REAL;

    // Inner loop (flow control)
    Flow_PV : REAL;
    Flow_Error : REAL;
    Flow_Output : REAL;

    // Proportional gains
    Kp_Outer : REAL := 1.2;
    Kp_Inner : REAL := 2.5;
END_VAR

// Outer loop logic: pressure control
Pressure_Error := Pressure_SP - Pressure_PV;
Flow_SP := Kp_Outer * Pressure_Error;

// Inner loop logic: flow control
Flow_Error := Flow_SP - Flow_PV;
Flow_Output := Kp_Inner * Flow_Error;

// Flow_Output drives the oil flow actuator (e.g., valve or pump)

This format ensures:
	â€¢	Fast response to oil inflow fluctuations
	â€¢	Stable control of vessel pressure
	â€¢	Code ready for real-world PLC integration with clear separation of control layers
