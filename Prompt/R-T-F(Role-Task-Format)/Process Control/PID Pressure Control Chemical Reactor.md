**PID Pressure Control Chemical Reactor:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for regulating the pressure in a chemical reactor. The program should continuously adjust the opening of a pressure control valve based on a setpoint to maintain optimal pressure levels within the reactor.

Include the PID control loop parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and ensure the logic accounts for pressure deviations from the setpoint. The program should also include safeguards to prevent over-pressurization or under-pressurization by limiting the valveâ€™s operational range. Discuss the critical role of pressure control in chemical reactors, emphasizing safety, process efficiency, and system stability under dynamic reaction conditions.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC control engineer responsible for developing a PID feedback control strategy using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. Your focus is on regulating pressure in a chemical reactor to ensure safety, efficiency, and stability under varying process conditions.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained Structured Text program (not a function block) that:
	1.	Monitors the current pressure (Pressure_PV) in the reactor
	2.	Uses a PID control loop to adjust the opening of a pressure control valve to maintain a desired setpoint (Pressure_SP := 5.0)
	3.	Implements the PID algorithm with:
	â€¢	Proportional gain (Kp := 2.0)
	â€¢	Integral gain (Ki := 0.8)
	â€¢	Derivative gain (Kd := 0.3)
	4.	Runs the loop every 100 ms and stores the internal PID states (Error, Integral, Prev_Error)
	5.	Limits the valve output (Valve_Output) between 0% and 100% to prevent unsafe overpressure or vacuum conditions

ðŸŸ¦ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

You should deliver a Structured Text code block like this:

VAR
    // Inputs
    Pressure_PV : REAL;                  // Measured reactor pressure (bar)
    Pressure_SP : REAL := 5.0;           // Pressure setpoint (bar)

    // PID gains
    Kp : REAL := 2.0;
    Ki : REAL := 0.8;
    Kd : REAL := 0.3;

    // Internal PID variables
    Error : REAL;
    Prev_Error : REAL := 0.0;
    Integral : REAL := 0.0;
    Derivative : REAL;
    Valve_Output : REAL;

    // Safety constraints
    Valve_Min : REAL := 0.0;
    Valve_Max : REAL := 100.0;
END_VAR

// PID control logic (100 ms cycle)
Error := Pressure_SP - Pressure_PV;
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1;
Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1;

Valve_Output := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative);

// Output clamping
IF Valve_Output > Valve_Max THEN
    Valve_Output := Valve_Max;
ELSIF Valve_Output < Valve_Min THEN
    Valve_Output := Valve_Min;
END_IF

Prev_Error := Error;
