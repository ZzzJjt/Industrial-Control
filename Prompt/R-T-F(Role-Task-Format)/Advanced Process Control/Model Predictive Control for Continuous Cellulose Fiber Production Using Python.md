**Model Predictive Control for Continuous Cellulose Fiber Production Using Python:**

Explain how model predictive control (MPC) can optimize cellulose fiber production from wood, where continuous infeed and outfeed operations are required, while the material undergoes a two-stage batch process. The material is supplied at an average rate of 50 tons per hour, undergoing pre-treatment in a reactor followed by homogenization before entering a 1,000 cubic meter buffer tank. The product is extracted from the tank on demand, not at a constant rate. To minimize downtime in downstream processes, a high fill level in the tank must be maintained, despite the two-hour delay caused by upstream batch processes, making PID control unsuitable.

Develop Python code to simulate the system dynamics, including the dead time and fluctuating demand.

Implement Python code for a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to optimize material flow, taking into account the time delay, fluctuating demand, and operational constraints.

**R-T-F:**

🟥 R（Role）

Act as a Python developer specializing in model predictive control (MPC) for hybrid continuous-batch industrial systems.

🟩 T（Task）

Explain how model predictive control (MPC) can optimize continuous cellulose fiber production from wood, which involves a two-stage batch process with a two-hour delay, and fluctuating demand from a 1,000 m³ buffer tank. Then, develop Python code to simulate the system dynamics and implement an MPC algorithm that adjusts infeed to maintain a high tank level, ensuring smooth downstream operation despite time delays and demand variability.

🟧 F（Format）

Provide:
	•	A clear explanation of MPC’s advantage over PID in handling delay and demand variability
	•	A Python simulation model of the reactor–homogenizer–tank system
	•	An MPC implementation that includes constraint handling and disturbance prediction
	•	Console outputs or logs of tank levels and feed rate over time (no plots required unless specified)
