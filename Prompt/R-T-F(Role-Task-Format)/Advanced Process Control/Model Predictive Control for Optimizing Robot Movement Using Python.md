**Model Predictive Control for Optimizing Robot Movement Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the movement of a robot. The control system should consider dynamic constraints, path planning, and obstacle avoidance while ensuring smooth, efficient, and adaptive movement in a dynamic environment.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as a Python developer focused on robotics control and motion optimization.

ðŸŸ© Tï¼ˆTaskï¼‰

Develop Python code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing a robotâ€™s movement. The controller must handle path planning, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic motion constraints to ensure smooth, efficient, and adaptive navigation in a dynamic environment.

ðŸŸ§ Fï¼ˆFormatï¼‰

Provide a well-structured Python script that includes:
	â€¢	A motion model of the robot (e.g., kinematic or dynamic model)
	â€¢	Implementation of the MPC algorithm with prediction and constraint handling
	â€¢	Integration of obstacle detection and avoidance logic
	â€¢	Simulation examples demonstrating real-time adaptation and smooth trajectory control (output via logs or optional visual plots)
