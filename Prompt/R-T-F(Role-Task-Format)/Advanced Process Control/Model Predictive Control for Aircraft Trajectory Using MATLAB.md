**Model Predictive Control for Aircraft Trajectory Using MATLAB:**

Develop MATLAB code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the trajectory of an aircraft. Ensure that the control scheme accounts for dynamic constraints, fuel efficiency, and external disturbances, while maintaining flight safety and performance objectives.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ Rï¼ˆRoleï¼‰

Act as a MATLAB developer focused on aerospace guidance and control systems.

ðŸŸ© Tï¼ˆTaskï¼‰

Develop MATLAB code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that optimizes the trajectory of an aircraft. The control system must consider dynamic constraints, enhance fuel efficiency, compensate for external disturbances (e.g., wind), and ensure safety and performance compliance.

ðŸŸ§ Fï¼ˆFormatï¼‰

Provide a complete MATLAB script including:
	â€¢	Aircraft dynamic model definition
	â€¢	MPC controller formulation with constraints and objectives
	â€¢	Simulation of trajectory scenarios under disturbance conditions
	â€¢	Output as numerical values or logs (optional: comments explaining each section)
