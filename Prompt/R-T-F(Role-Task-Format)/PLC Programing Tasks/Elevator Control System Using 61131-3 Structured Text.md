**Elevator Control System Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program to control an elevator in a 5-floor building. Each floor has top and bottom limit switches to detect the elevator’s position. The elevator door should remain open for 7 seconds after reaching a floor. If no buttons inside the elevator cabin are pressed during this time, the door should reopen for an additional 10 seconds before closing. The elevator’s movement is governed by its current direction and the direction imposed by the up and down call buttons on each

**R-T-F:**

🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a PLC control systems engineer responsible for programming an elevator control system in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. Your focus is on ensuring correct floor detection, door timing logic, and safe directional movement across 5 floors, with responsiveness to cabin and call button inputs.

🟩 T (Task) – What You Need to Do

Develop a Structured Text program (not a function block) to control an elevator with the following requirements:
	1.	Floor and Position Detection:
	•	Use top and bottom limit switches (e.g., AtFloor[1..5]) to determine elevator position at each floor.
	2.	Door Control Logic:
	•	Upon arriving at a floor, open the door and keep it open for 7 seconds.
	•	If no cabin request is received during this period, extend door open time by an additional 10 seconds.
	•	Then close the door automatically.
	3.	Call and Request Handling:
	•	Accept floor calls from UpCall[1..4] and **DownCall[2..5]`.
	•	Handle CabinRequest[1..5] inputs for destination selection.
	4.	Movement and Direction Logic:
	•	Follow the current movement direction (GoingUp or GoingDown).
	•	Prioritize requests in the current direction before reversing.
	•	Ensure the elevator does not move when the door is open.
	5.	Safety Requirements:
	•	Prevent motion while the door is open.
	•	Reset timers correctly between floors.
	•	Ignore repeated or invalid requests if the elevator is already at the requested floor.

🟧 F (Format) – Expected Output

You should produce a Structured Text program structured similarly to this logic:
IF AtFloor[CurrentFloor] THEN
    DoorOpen := TRUE;
    Timer7s(IN := TRUE, PT := T#7s);

    IF Timer7s.Q THEN
        IF NOT AnyCabinRequest THEN
            Timer10s(IN := TRUE, PT := T#10s);
            IF Timer10s.Q THEN
                DoorOpen := FALSE;
            END_IF;
        ELSE
            DoorOpen := FALSE;
        END_IF;
    END_IF;
END_IF;

// Movement is only allowed when the door is closed
IF NOT DoorOpen THEN
    IF GoingUp THEN
        // Check for requests above
    ELSIF GoingDown THEN
        // Check for requests below
    END_IF;
END_IF;
The final program must:
	•	Control elevator movement between 5 floors based on request and direction logic
	•	Implement timed door behavior with a conditional extension
	•	Stop motion if the door is not fully closed
	•	Be modular and easily adaptable for additional features (e.g., emergency stop, overload detection, floor display)
