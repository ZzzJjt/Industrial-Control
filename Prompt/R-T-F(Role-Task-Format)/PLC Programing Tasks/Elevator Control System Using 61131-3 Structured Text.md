**Elevator Control System Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program to control an elevator in a 5-floor building. Each floor has top and bottom limit switches to detect the elevatorâ€™s position. The elevator door should remain open for 7 seconds after reaching a floor. If no buttons inside the elevator cabin are pressed during this time, the door should reopen for an additional 10 seconds before closing. The elevatorâ€™s movement is governed by its current direction and the direction imposed by the up and down call buttons on each

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC control systems engineer responsible for programming an elevator control system in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. Your focus is on ensuring correct floor detection, door timing logic, and safe directional movement across 5 floors, with responsiveness to cabin and call button inputs.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a Structured Text program (not a function block) to control an elevator with the following requirements:
	1.	Floor and Position Detection:
	â€¢	Use top and bottom limit switches (e.g., AtFloor[1..5]) to determine elevator position at each floor.
	2.	Door Control Logic:
	â€¢	Upon arriving at a floor, open the door and keep it open for 7 seconds.
	â€¢	If no cabin request is received during this period, extend door open time by an additional 10 seconds.
	â€¢	Then close the door automatically.
	3.	Call and Request Handling:
	â€¢	Accept floor calls from UpCall[1..4] and **DownCall[2..5]`.
	â€¢	Handle CabinRequest[1..5] inputs for destination selection.
	4.	Movement and Direction Logic:
	â€¢	Follow the current movement direction (GoingUp or GoingDown).
	â€¢	Prioritize requests in the current direction before reversing.
	â€¢	Ensure the elevator does not move when the door is open.
	5.	Safety Requirements:
	â€¢	Prevent motion while the door is open.
	â€¢	Reset timers correctly between floors.
	â€¢	Ignore repeated or invalid requests if the elevator is already at the requested floor.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

You should produce a Structured Text program structured similarly to this logic:
IF AtFloor[CurrentFloor] THEN
    DoorOpen := TRUE;
    Timer7s(IN := TRUE, PT := T#7s);

    IF Timer7s.Q THEN
        IF NOT AnyCabinRequest THEN
            Timer10s(IN := TRUE, PT := T#10s);
            IF Timer10s.Q THEN
                DoorOpen := FALSE;
            END_IF;
        ELSE
            DoorOpen := FALSE;
        END_IF;
    END_IF;
END_IF;

// Movement is only allowed when the door is closed
IF NOT DoorOpen THEN
    IF GoingUp THEN
        // Check for requests above
    ELSIF GoingDown THEN
        // Check for requests below
    END_IF;
END_IF;
The final program must:
	â€¢	Control elevator movement between 5 floors based on request and direction logic
	â€¢	Implement timed door behavior with a conditional extension
	â€¢	Stop motion if the door is not fully closed
	â€¢	Be modular and easily adaptable for additional features (e.g., emergency stop, overload detection, floor display)
