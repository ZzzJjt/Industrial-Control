**Pick-and-Place Application for a Robot Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards for a pick-and-place robotic application with two conveyors, following the process described below:

Process Description:

The system operates in two modes: Manual Mode and Auto Mode. These modes are interlocked, meaning only one can be active at any time.

	1.	Manual Mode:
	â€¢	When the Manual button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the following steps in response to individual manual commands:
	â€¢	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A.
	â€¢	Transfer: Move the product to conveyor B.
	â€¢	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B, allowing it to be carried away.
	2.	Auto Mode:
	â€¢	When the Auto button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the entire pick-and-place process automatically:
	â€¢	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A and hold it.
	â€¢	Transfer: Transfer the product to conveyor B (this action takes 2 seconds).
	â€¢	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B.
	â€¢	The auto process completes after one cycle, but can be re-triggered by pressing the Auto button again.

The system should ensure that manual and auto modes cannot operate simultaneously, using interlocking logic to prevent conflicts between the two modes.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC engineer tasked with writing a Structured Text (ST) program in compliance with IEC 61131-3 standards to control a pick-and-place robot operating with two conveyors. Your focus is on creating a robust and safe system that supports both manual and automatic modes.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained ST program (not a function block) that:
	1.	Implements Two Modes:
	â€¢	Manual Mode: Activated by a manual button. In this mode, the robot responds to individual commands:
	â€¢	Clip â€“ pick a product from Conveyor A
	â€¢	Transfer â€“ move the product to Conveyor B
	â€¢	Release â€“ drop the product on Conveyor B
	â€¢	Auto Mode: Activated by an auto button. In this mode, the robot executes the full sequence automatically:
	â€¢	Clip â†’ Transfer (with a 2-second delay) â†’ Release
	2.	Ensures Mode Interlock:
	â€¢	Manual and Auto modes must be mutually exclusive â€” only one can be active at a time.
	3.	Executes One Auto Cycle Per Trigger:
	â€¢	Pressing the Auto button should initiate one complete cycle.
	â€¢	Auto sequence can be retriggered with another press.
	4.	Implements State Logic in Auto Mode:
	â€¢	Use a State variable and a TON timer to manage the 2-second transfer delay.

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

You will provide a clean, modular Structured Text program, like this:

VAR
    BtnManual, BtnAuto : BOOL;
    ManualMode, AutoMode : BOOL;
    CmdClip, CmdTransfer, CmdRelease : BOOL;
    AutoTrigger : BOOL := FALSE;
    State : INT := 0;
    AutoTimer : TON;
END_VAR

// Interlock: Activate one mode only
IF BtnManual THEN
    ManualMode := TRUE;
    AutoMode := FALSE;
ELSIF BtnAuto THEN
    AutoMode := TRUE;
    ManualMode := FALSE;
END_IF

// Manual mode operation
IF ManualMode THEN
    IF CmdClip THEN
        // Perform Clip action
    END_IF;
    IF CmdTransfer THEN
        // Perform Transfer action
    END_IF;
    IF CmdRelease THEN
        // Perform Release action
    END_IF;
END_IF

// Auto mode trigger
IF AutoMode AND BtnAuto THEN
    AutoTrigger := TRUE;
END_IF

// Auto sequence logic
IF AutoMode AND AutoTrigger THEN
    CASE State OF
        0:
            // Perform Clip
            State := 1;
        1:
            // Start transfer with 2-second delay
            AutoTimer(IN := TRUE, PT := T#2s);
            IF AutoTimer.Q THEN
                AutoTimer(IN := FALSE);
                State := 2;
            END_IF;
        2:
            // Perform Release
            AutoTrigger := FALSE;
            State := 0;
    END_CASE;
END_IF
This program will ensure:
	â€¢	Safe and reliable mode switching
	â€¢	Precise control in both manual and automatic operations
	â€¢	Timing-based automation using structured and readable logic
