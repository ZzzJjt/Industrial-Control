**Automatic Car Wash Station Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards to control an automatic car wash station with a single wash bay. The system should use a sensor to detect the presence of a car. Once the car is detected and no human is present in the wash area, the system should initiate the car wash process. If a human is detected within the car wash area at any point, the station should immediately stop the wash process, trigger an alarm, and remain in a safe state until the area is clear.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC automation engineer responsible for developing safe and responsive control logic for an automatic car wash station. Your work must comply with IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) standards and prioritize both operational flow and human safety.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a Structured Text program that controls a single-bay automatic car wash with the following behavior:
	â€¢	Use input sensors to detect:
	â€¢	CarPresentSensor : BOOL â€” car detected inside the wash bay
	â€¢	HumanDetectedSensor : BOOL â€” human presence detected in the wash zone
	â€¢	Implement output logic to:
	â€¢	WashActive : BOOL â€” TRUE when wash is running
	â€¢	AlarmActive : BOOL â€” TRUE when a person is detected in a danger zone
	â€¢	SafeToRun : BOOL â€” internal flag to allow or lock the start of a new wash cycle
	â€¢	Core logic must:
	â€¢	Start the wash only if a car is present, no human is detected, and the system is in a safe state
	â€¢	Immediately stop the wash and raise an alarm if a human is detected at any time
	â€¢	Lock out the wash system (SafeToRun := FALSE) until the area is clear and no cycle is active
	â€¢	Reset SafeToRun only after the wash has stopped and the area is confirmed safe

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

You should deliver a complete and clear IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block or program section, for example:
CarPresent := CarPresentSensor;
HumanDetected := HumanDetectedSensor;

IF HumanDetected THEN
    WashActive := FALSE;
    AlarmActive := TRUE;
    SafeToRun := FALSE;
ELSIF CarPresent AND NOT HumanDetected AND SafeToRun THEN
    WashActive := TRUE;
    AlarmActive := FALSE;
END_IF;

// Reset safety flag after conditions are met
IF NOT HumanDetected AND NOT WashActive THEN
    SafeToRun := TRUE;
END_IF;
Your final solution should:
	â€¢	Be easy to read and maintain
	â€¢	Prevent hazardous conditions through robust interlocks
	â€¢	Be ready for integration with HMI systems, emergency stops, and actuator control
