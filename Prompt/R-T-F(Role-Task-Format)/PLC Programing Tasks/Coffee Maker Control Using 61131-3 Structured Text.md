**Coffee Maker Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text (ST) program to control a coffee machine that manages three tanks (coffee, milk, and mixer) and three valves (one for coffee, one for milk, and one for output). The machine should mix coffee and milk properly to create the best output, following this process:

System Description:

	1.	Tanks and Valves:
	â€¢	The coffee and milk valves open to fill the mixer tank. The mixer tank can hold up to 130ml, and when it reaches the maximum level, the coffee and milk valves will close.
	2.	Mixing Process:
	â€¢	Once the tank is full, the mixer starts automatically and runs for 4 seconds. After mixing is complete, the output valve opens to dispense the coffee.
	3.	Control Buttons:
	â€¢	Button 1: Emergency Stop â€” Stops the entire system instantly in case of malfunction, such as valve failures, tank level issues, or mixer failures.
	â€¢	Button 2: Start â€” Begins the coffee-making process.
	â€¢	Button 3: Coffee and Milk â€” Prepares coffee with milk by opening both the coffee and milk valves.
	â€¢	Button 4: Coffee Only â€” Prepares coffee without milk by only opening the coffee valve.

Safety Features:

	â€¢	Implement the emergency stop to handle unexpected events, such as valve malfunctions, tank level detection failures, or mixer operation failures. When triggered, the system should stop immediately to ensure safety.

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer responsible for designing and implementing a safe, state-driven control program for a fully automated coffee maker using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST). Your focus is on process sequencing, emergency handling, and modular code logic.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Create a structured text control program that manages the following components of the coffee machine:
	â€¢	Tanks:
	â€¢	Coffee Tank
	â€¢	Milk Tank
	â€¢	Mixer Tank (with a 130ml maximum capacity)
	â€¢	Valves:
	â€¢	CoffeeValve â€” opens to add coffee to mixer
	â€¢	MilkValve â€” opens to add milk to mixer
	â€¢	OutputValve â€” opens to dispense final mixed drink
	â€¢	Mixer Motor:
	â€¢	Mixer â€” runs for 4 seconds once tank is full
	â€¢	Control Inputs:
	â€¢	EmergencyStop â€” stops all operations immediately
	â€¢	Start â€” initiates the brewing process
	â€¢	CoffeeMilk â€” selects drink with both coffee and milk
	â€¢	CoffeeOnly â€” selects drink with only coffee
	â€¢	Sensors:
	â€¢	MixerLevelFull â€” detects when the mixer tank is full

Functional Logic Requirements:
	1.	When Start is pressed, check the selected mode:
	â€¢	If CoffeeMilk is selected, open both coffee and milk valves
	â€¢	If CoffeeOnly is selected, open only the coffee valve
	2.	Once the mixer is full (MixerLevelFull = TRUE), close all valves and start the mixer
	3.	After 4 seconds of mixing, stop the mixer and open the output valve to dispense
	4.	If EmergencyStop = TRUE at any point:
	â€¢	Immediately stop all valves and mixer
	â€¢	Block the process until reset manually or after inspection

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Produce a clear, state-machine-driven structured text program that may look like:
CASE State OF
    0: // Idle
        IF Start THEN
            IF CoffeeMilk THEN
                CoffeeValve := TRUE;
                MilkValve := TRUE;
            ELSIF CoffeeOnly THEN
                CoffeeValve := TRUE;
            END_IF;
            State := 1;
        END_IF;

    1: // Filling
        IF MixerLevelFull THEN
            CoffeeValve := FALSE;
            MilkValve := FALSE;
            Mixer := TRUE;
            MixTimer(IN:=TRUE, PT:=T#4s);
            State := 2;
        END_IF;

    2: // Mixing
        IF MixTimer.Q THEN
            Mixer := FALSE;
            OutputValve := TRUE;
            State := 3;
        END_IF;

    3: // Dispensing
        // Optional: transition back to idle after dispensing
END_CASE;

// Emergency override
IF EmergencyStop THEN
    CoffeeValve := FALSE;
    MilkValve := FALSE;
    Mixer := FALSE;
    OutputValve := FALSE;
    State := 0;
END_IF;
Your final solution should ensure:
	â€¢	Safe sequencing, even under fault conditions
	â€¢	Manual mode flexibility (coffee-only or coffee-with-milk)
	â€¢	Emergency compliance, with immediate and total system shutdown
	â€¢	A design that is modular, readable, and ready for deployment
