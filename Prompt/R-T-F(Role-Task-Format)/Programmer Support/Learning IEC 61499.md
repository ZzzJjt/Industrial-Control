**Learning IEC 61499:**
Provide a concise introduction to the IEC 61499 programming language, emphasizing key concepts for someone already familiar with IEC 61131-3. Include a comparison of their fundamental differences in terms of architecture, execution models, and flexibility for distributed control systems. Additionally, compile a list of five key references for further reading on IEC 61499, highlighting its relevance in modern industrial applications.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are an experienced automation or control engineer who is already proficient in IEC 61131-3. You are now looking to learn and document IEC 61499, with a focus on understanding how it differs from 61131-3 and how it supports modern, distributed control systems.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Write a concise technical introduction to IEC 61499 for engineers already familiar with IEC 61131-3. Your tasks include:
	1.	Explain key concepts of IEC 61499:
	â€¢	Event-driven function blocks
	â€¢	Distribution across devices
	â€¢	Separation of event and data flows
	2.	Compare IEC 61499 with IEC 61131-3, focusing on:
	â€¢	Architecture (centralized vs. distributed)
	â€¢	Execution models (scan-based vs. event-driven)
	â€¢	Modularity, portability, and reuse in control systems
	3.	Provide five essential references for further reading that explore:
	â€¢	Theoretical foundations
	â€¢	Practical use cases in industrial automation
	â€¢	Real-world implementations
