**Profibus DPV1 Diagnostics Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program to retrieve diagnostic data from a Profibus device using the Profibus DPV1 protocol. The program should implement a CASE statement to handle 10 specific diagnostic data types, such as communication errors, device status, and parameter faults. Each diagnostic type should be mapped to a concrete data type, ensuring that the retrieved information is processed accurately and efficiently. Discuss the logic behind handling these diagnostic data types, including error detection and fault handling mechanisms, to ensure robust communication with the Profibus device.

**R-T-F:**

🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer developing diagnostic management logic for Profibus DPV1 devices using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

⸻

🟩 T (Task) – What You Need to Do

Create a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that retrieves and processes diagnostic data from a Profibus DPV1 device. The program must use a CASE statement to handle 10 specific diagnostic types, including:
	•	Communication errors
	•	Device status
	•	Parameter faults
	•	Hardware faults
	•	Watchdog timeouts
	•	Configuration mismatches
	•	Power supply issues
	•	Bus interruptions
	•	Temperature warnings
	•	Manufacturer-specific messages

Each diagnostic type should be parsed and mapped to a specific variable or structure, and appropriate error or fault flags should be set for the control system to respond.

🟧 F (Format) – Expected Output

Deliver an IEC 61131-3 ST program that includes:
	•	Inputs: a trigger signal (e.g., Execute), a target device address, and optional timeout or retry parameters
	•	A CASE-based diagnostic parser that matches type codes and maps data to variables
	•	Outputs: structured variables (e.g., CommError: BOOL, TempWarning: BOOL), as well as general status flags (Done, Error, ErrorID)
	•	Robust error-handling logic for unknown diagnostic types or communication failures
	•	Inline comments for maintainability and integration into existing PLC control programs
