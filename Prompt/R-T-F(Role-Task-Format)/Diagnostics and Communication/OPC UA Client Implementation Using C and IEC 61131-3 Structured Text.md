**OPC UA Client Implementation Using C and IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop C-code for an OPC UA client, then wrap it into an IEC 61131-based function block written in structured text (ST). The function block should have the following input pins: Execute (type: BOOL), ServerUrl (type: STRING[255]), and Timeout (type: TIME). The output pins should include Done (type: BOOL), Busy (type: BOOL), Error (type: BOOL), and ErrorID (type: DWORD). In your explanation, describe how the C-code interfaces with the OPC UA server, how the function block manages communication with the server, and how error handling is implemented. Provide details on how to integrate this function block within an IEC 61131-3 environment for reliable client-server communication.

**R-T-F:**

🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

Act as a control systems programmer integrating C-based communication libraries into an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) environment for industrial automation.

🟩 T (Task) – What You Need to Do

Develop a C-based OPC UA client using a library such as open62541, and encapsulate its functionality within an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text function block. The function block must manage connection lifecycle and expose a clear interface to PLC programmers:

Inputs:
	•	Execute (BOOL): Starts the connection attempt
	•	ServerUrl (STRING[255]): Specifies the target OPC UA server
	•	Timeout (TIME): Defines the maximum time to wait for a response

Outputs:
	•	Done (BOOL): Indicates successful completion
	•	Busy (BOOL): Signals an ongoing connection attempt
	•	Error (BOOL): Signals failure
	•	ErrorID (DWORD): Provides diagnostic information

Additionally, you must describe how the C code interfaces with the OPC UA server and how the ST function block tracks execution status, handles timeouts, and reports errors.

🟧 F (Format) – Expected Output

Deliver:
	•	A modular and reusable ST function block implementing the above interface
	•	A C function or library that establishes and manages OPC UA client connections
	•	Internal logic within the ST block for rising-edge detection on Execute, non-blocking status transitions (Busy, Done), and structured error reporting via ErrorID
	•	Integration documentation explaining how to link the C code to the ST block and embed it in a typical PLC cycle
