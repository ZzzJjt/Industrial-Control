**Profibus DP Diagnostics Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text function block to read diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The function block should handle communication with the Profibus DP slave and retrieve diagnostic information such as device status, error codes, and communication health. Provide an explanation of the key steps in processing the diagnostic data, including request initiation, data retrieval, and error handling mechanisms.

**R-T-F:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a PLC developer tasked with building diagnostic tools using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for Profibus DP networks.

ðŸŸ© T (Task) â€“ What You Need to Do

Develop a self-contained Structured Text (ST) function block that reads diagnostic data from a Profibus DP slave device. The block should:
	â€¢	Initiate diagnostic requests to the specified slave
	â€¢	Retrieve and interpret data such as device status, communication health, and error codes
	â€¢	Handle timeouts and communication failures
	â€¢	Output status indicators and parsed diagnostic information to the PLC program

ðŸŸ§ F (Format) â€“ Expected Output

Deliver a reusable IEC 61131-3 ST function block with:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	Execute (BOOL): Triggers the diagnostic read
	â€¢	SlaveAddress (BYTE): Identifies the target slave
	â€¢	Timeout (TIME): Defines maximum wait time
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	Done (BOOL): TRUE when diagnostics are successfully retrieved
	â€¢	Busy (BOOL): TRUE while waiting for response
	â€¢	Error (BOOL): TRUE if the operation fails
	â€¢	ErrorID (DWORD): Error code for diagnostics
	â€¢	Optional: DeviceStatus, CommHealth, or structured diagnostic data

Include internal logic to detect a rising edge on Execute, track operation state, parse the diagnostic data, and handle communication faults gracefully.
