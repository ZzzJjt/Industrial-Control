**Interlock Distillation Column:**

Develop a P&I diagram in textual notation for a distillation column, detailing the process equipment, instrumentation, control functions, safety interlocks, and piping. Use typical tagnames to represent elements such as the column (C-101), reboiler (E-101), condenser (E-102), level transmitters (LT-101), pressure transmitters (PT-101), and control valves (FV-101). Ensure the notation includes both the control functions and the safety interlocks, specifying their interactions with the piping and instrumentation system.

Following this, write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement the interlocks of the distillation column. Include high and low limits for critical parameters such as pressure, temperature, and liquid level. For instance, trigger the pressure relief valve if the column pressure exceeds 120 psi (high limit) or shut off the feed valve if the pressure drops below 50 psi (low limit). Similarly, close the reboiler heat supply if the temperature exceeds 180Â°C. Discuss the role of interlocks in maintaining safe operating conditions within the distillation process.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

Act as a control systems or process safety engineer tasked with designing both the interlock logic and instrumentation layout for a chemical distillation column using industry-standard tools and programming practices.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are to develop:

	1.	A text-based P&I (Piping & Instrumentation) diagram for a distillation column system, including:
	â€¢	C-101 (column), E-101 (reboiler), E-102 (condenser)
	â€¢	Sensors: PT-101 (pressure), TT-101 (temperature), LT-101 (level)
	â€¢	Actuators: FV-101 (feed valve), PRV-101 (pressure relief valve)
	2.	An IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program implementing interlock logic based on high and low thresholds, such as:
	â€¢	Open PRV-101 if pressure > 120 psi
	â€¢	Close FV-101 if pressure < 50 psi
	â€¢	Shut off reboiler heat if temperature > 180Â°C
	3.	A written explanation of how these interlocks ensure safe operation under abnormal conditions.

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do

	1.	Draft the textual P&I diagram, listing all equipment, piping, instruments, and control loops with standard tagnames. Indicate how transmitters influence actuators.
	2.	Write the ST interlock logic, using IF/THEN conditions that monitor sensor values and trigger safety responses.
	3.	Explain how the interlocks:
	â€¢	Respond to process deviations in real time
	â€¢	Prevent unsafe conditions like overpressure or overheating
	â€¢	Maintain process stability and protect equipment
	4.	Ensure the program is self-contained and structured for reusability and easy troubleshooting.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You deliver a complete interlock design package: a readable textual P&I diagram, reliable Structured Text code, and a rationale explaining how the logic protects the process. This solution allows real-time response to process hazards, enhances safety compliance, and serves as documentation for operators, auditors, and future engineering reviews.
