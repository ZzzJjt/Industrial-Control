**Pick-and-Place Application for a Robot Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards for a pick-and-place robotic application with two conveyors, following the process described below:

Process Description:

The system operates in two modes: Manual Mode and Auto Mode. These modes are interlocked, meaning only one can be active at any time.

	1.	Manual Mode:
	•	When the Manual button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the following steps in response to individual manual commands:
	•	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A.
	•	Transfer: Move the product to conveyor B.
	•	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B, allowing it to be carried away.
	2.	Auto Mode:
	•	When the Auto button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the entire pick-and-place process automatically:
	•	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A and hold it.
	•	Transfer: Transfer the product to conveyor B (this action takes 2 seconds).
	•	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B.
	•	The auto process completes after one cycle, but can be re-triggered by pressing the Auto button again.

The system should ensure that manual and auto modes cannot operate simultaneously, using interlocking logic to prevent conflicts between the two modes.

**R-I-S-E:**

🟥 R (Role) – Your Role

You are a PLC programmer responsible for developing a Structured Text (ST) program according to IEC 61131-3 standards. Your goal is to implement control logic for a pick-and-place robotic arm with two operating modes: Manual and Auto, while ensuring interlocks and safe operation.

🟩 I (Input) – What You’re Given

🔘 Mode Selection:
	•	BtnManual: Activates Manual Mode
	•	BtnAuto: Activates Auto Mode
	•	Only one mode may be active at a time (interlocked)

🎮 Manual Mode Commands:
	•	CmdClip: Pick product from Conveyor A
	•	CmdTransfer: Move product to Conveyor B
	•	CmdRelease: Drop product on Conveyor B

🤖 Auto Mode Sequence (triggered by Auto button):
	•	Clip → Transfer (2-second delay) → Release
	•	Performs one complete cycle per trigger

🚦 Outputs (you define the actions):
	•	Robot performs tasks as directed by mode-specific logic

⸻

🟧 S (Steps) – What You Need to Do
	1.	Implement Mode Interlock Logic
	•	When BtnManual is pressed, activate ManualMode and disable AutoMode.
	•	When BtnAuto is pressed, activate AutoMode and disable ManualMode.
	2.	Handle Manual Mode Logic
	•	Respond to CmdClip, CmdTransfer, and CmdRelease independently.
	•	Robot should perform only the task issued by the corresponding button.
	•	No sequence or delay logic is required in manual mode.
	3.	Handle Auto Mode Logic
	•	On rising edge of BtnAuto, set AutoTrigger := TRUE.
	•	Use a state machine to perform:
	•	State 0: Clip
	•	State 1: Transfer (wait 2 seconds using a TON timer)
	•	State 2: Release and reset the sequence
	4.	Ensure Safety and Robustness
	•	Reset timers and state machine at the end of each Auto cycle
	•	Prevent overlapping commands or simultaneous mode activation

⸻

🟦 E (Expectation) – What Success Looks Like

Your final program will:
	•	Ensure safe, interlocked switching between Manual and Auto modes
	•	Allow step-by-step control of the robot in Manual mode
	•	Execute a timed, automated pick-and-place sequence in Auto mode
	•	Be easily extensible for status indicators, alarms, or cycle counters
	•	Follow best practices in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text

    BtnManual, BtnAuto : BOOL;
    ManualMode, AutoMode, AutoTrigger : BOOL;
    CmdClip, CmdTransfer, CmdRelease : BOOL;
    State : INT := 0;
    AutoTimer : TON;
END_VAR

// Interlock logic
IF BtnManual THEN
    ManualMode := TRUE;
    AutoMode := FALSE;
ELSIF BtnAuto THEN
    AutoMode := TRUE;
    ManualMode := FALSE;
END_IF

// Manual control logic
IF ManualMode THEN
    IF CmdClip THEN
        // Clip from Conveyor A
    END_IF;
    IF CmdTransfer THEN
        // Move to Conveyor B
    END_IF;
    IF CmdRelease THEN
        // Release on Conveyor B
    END_IF;
END_IF

// Auto mode trigger
IF AutoMode AND BtnAuto THEN
    AutoTrigger := TRUE;
END_IF

// Auto sequence logic
IF AutoMode AND AutoTrigger THEN
    CASE State OF
        0: 
            // Clip action
            State := 1;
        1:
            AutoTimer(IN := TRUE, PT := T#2s);
            IF AutoTimer.Q THEN
                AutoTimer(IN := FALSE);
                State := 2;
            END_IF;
        2:
            // Release action
            AutoTrigger := FALSE;
            State := 0;
    END_CASE;
