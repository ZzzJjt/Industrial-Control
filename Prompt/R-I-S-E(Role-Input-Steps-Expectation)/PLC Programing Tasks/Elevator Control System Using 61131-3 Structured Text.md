**Elevator Control System Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program to control an elevator in a 5-floor building. Each floor has top and bottom limit switches to detect the elevatorâ€™s position. The elevator door should remain open for 7 seconds after reaching a floor. If no buttons inside the elevator cabin are pressed during this time, the door should reopen for an additional 10 seconds before closing. The elevatorâ€™s movement is governed by its current direction and the direction imposed by the up and down call buttons on each

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer developing an elevator control system using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. Your program must safely manage the elevatorâ€™s position, door operation, direction logic, and call button responses across 5 floors.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

Your system has the following components:
	â€¢	Position Detection:
	â€¢	AtFloor[1..5] : BOOL â€“ one per floor to detect the elevatorâ€™s position
	â€¢	Each floor includes TopLimit and BottomLimit switches
	â€¢	Door Logic:
	â€¢	The door opens upon arrival at a floor
	â€¢	Door remains open for 7 seconds
	â€¢	If no cabin button is pressed, the door reopens for an additional 10 seconds
	â€¢	Requests:
	â€¢	CabinRequest[1..5] : BOOL â€“ cabin floor selections
	â€¢	UpCall[1..4], DownCall[2..5] : BOOL â€“ up/down buttons on floors
	â€¢	Movement Logic:
	â€¢	Current direction: GoingUp : BOOL
	â€¢	Requests are served based on current direction of travel
	â€¢	When no more requests in that direction, the elevator should reverse
	â€¢	Safety Conditions:
	â€¢	Elevator must not move when the door is open
	â€¢	Pending requests must be cleared before going idle

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Detect floor arrival and initiate door sequence:
	â€¢	If AtFloor[i] = TRUE, open the door and start a 7-second timer
	â€¢	If no cabin button is pressed in this time, start a 10-second timer to extend the door open state
	â€¢	After timers expire, close the door
	2.	Disable motion during door operations:
	â€¢	Prevent elevator movement while DoorOpen = TRUE
	3.	Handle request prioritization:
	â€¢	While moving up, check CabinRequest[i] and UpCall[i] above the current floor
	â€¢	While moving down, check CabinRequest[i] and DownCall[i] below the current floor
	â€¢	If no requests in current direction, switch direction
	4.	Manage state transitions and timers using structured text:

 IF AtFloor[CurrentFloor] THEN
    DoorOpen := TRUE;
    Timer1(IN := TRUE, PT := T#7s);
    
    IF Timer1.Q THEN
        IF NOT AnyCabinRequest THEN
            Timer2(IN := TRUE, PT := T#10s);
            IF Timer2.Q THEN
                DoorOpen := FALSE;
            END_IF;
        ELSE
            DoorOpen := FALSE;
        END_IF;
    END_IF;
END_IF;

IF NOT DoorOpen THEN
    // Evaluate requests and update motion direction
END_IF;

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

You will deliver a robust, standards-compliant Structured Text program that:
	â€¢	Operates an elevator across 5 floors
	â€¢	Manages door timing and logic responsively using 7s/10s behavior
	â€¢	Responds to cabin and floor call buttons according to direction
	â€¢	Prioritizes passenger safety by disallowing motion during door operations
	â€¢	Can be extended to include display systems, overload protection, or emergency logic
