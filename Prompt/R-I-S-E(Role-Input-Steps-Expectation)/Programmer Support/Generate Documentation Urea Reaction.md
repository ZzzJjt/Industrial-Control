**Generate Documentation Urea Reaction:**

Generate a developer documentation for the following code: PROGRAM UreaReactionControl VAR // Inputs stAmmoniaValve : BOOL; // TRUE when ammonia valve is open stCO2Valve : BOOL; // TRUE when CO2 valve is open rCurrentPressure : REAL; rCurrentTemperature : REAL;
// Outputs
stAmmoniaValveControl : BOOL; // TRUE to open ammonia valve
stCO2ValveControl : BOOL; // TRUE to open CO2 valve

// Internal variables
stStep1 : BOOL := FALSE; // Load raw materials
stStep2 : BOOL := FALSE; // Control reaction
stReactionFinished : BOOL := FALSE; // Reaction finished flag

// Parameters
rTargetPressure : REAL := 175.0; // Target reactor pressure in bars
rPressureTolerance : REAL := 5.0; // Pressure tolerance in bars
rTargetTemperature : REAL := 185.0; // Target reactor temperature in ï¿½C
rTemperatureTolerance : REAL := 2.0; // Temperature tolerance in ï¿½C
tReactionTime : TIME := T#30m; // Total reaction time
tReactionTimer : TIME; // Reaction timer
END_VAR
// Main sequence control
IF NOT stReactionFinished THEN

    // Step 1: Load raw materials
    IF NOT stStep1 THEN

            tReactionTimer := CURRENT_TIME;  // Record current time to start reaction timing
        END_IF

    // Step 2: Control reaction
    ELSIF NOT stStep2 THEN
        // Check if current pressure and temperature are within the target range

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC control system developer responsible for documenting an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program titled UreaReactionControl. The goal is to create a clear, professional-level technical documentation that will help other engineers understand, maintain, and verify the logic of the urea reaction process.

â¸»

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are provided with a full ST program that:
	â€¢	Opens ammonia and COâ‚‚ valves to load raw materials
	â€¢	Monitors pressure and temperature conditions inside a reactor
	â€¢	Times the urea reaction process over a fixed period
	â€¢	Contains internal states for tracking progress (e.g., step flags, timer, and finished flag)
	â€¢	Uses threshold values and tolerances to determine safe operation

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Summarize the programâ€™s purpose: Explain that it controls a two-phase urea reaction involving material loading and monitored reaction timing.
	2.	Describe all variables:
	â€¢	Inputs (e.g., valve status, sensor readings)
	â€¢	Outputs (e.g., valve control signals)
	â€¢	Internal control flags
	â€¢	Reaction parameters like pressure, temperature, and timing
	3.	Outline the control flow:
	â€¢	Step 1: Open valves and wait until both confirm open
	â€¢	Step 2: Check whether pressure and temperature are within range
	â€¢	Start the timer and keep conditions steady until the reaction time completes
	â€¢	Final: Close valves and set the finished flag
	4.	Clarify timer logic: Highlight how the CURRENT_TIME is used to track the duration of the reaction process.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What the Output Should Look Like

The final output should be a well-organized, developer-friendly documentation that includes:
	â€¢	A purpose section
	â€¢	A variable list (with types and descriptions)
	â€¢	A logic flow explanation (step-by-step control behavior)
	â€¢	Notes on how and when valves are triggered
	â€¢	Description of reaction success criteria (temperature/pressure/timer)
	â€¢	A ready-to-use reference for future development, safety checks, and compliance
