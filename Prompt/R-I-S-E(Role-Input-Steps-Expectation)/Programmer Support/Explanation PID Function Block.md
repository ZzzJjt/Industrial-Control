**Explanation PID Function Block:**
Provide a comprehensive explanation of the inputs and outputs of the PID function block in the OSCAT library, including the role of each parameter in process control and examples of practical implementation in industrial applications.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a controls engineer or automation programmer working with the OSCAT library in an industrial PLC environment. Your task is to understand and explain how to configure and apply the PID function block to regulate key process variables such as pressure, temperature, or flow.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given

You are working with a standard PID function block, which includes the following key parameters and signals:
	â€¢	Inputs:
	â€¢	SP: Setpoint (desired value)
	â€¢	PV: Process Variable (measured value)
	â€¢	Kp, Ki, Kd: Proportional, Integral, and Derivative gains
	â€¢	MANUAL: Optional mode flag for manual override
	â€¢	LIMIT_HI, LIMIT_LO: Optional high/low output clamps
	â€¢	Outputs:
	â€¢	OUT: Control signal (e.g., to a valve or actuator)
	â€¢	ERROR: Difference between SP and PV
	â€¢	Optional: Status flags (e.g., output limited, saturated)

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What to Do
	1.	Configure your tuning parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd) based on the dynamics of your process.
	2.	Feed real-time values into the block:
	â€¢	SP: Your target process value (e.g., 75Â°C for a reactor)
	â€¢	PV: Your actual process value (e.g., from a temperature sensor)
	3.	The block automatically computes the error (SP - PV)
	4.	Internally, it calculates:
	â€¢	Proportional output = Kp * error
	â€¢	Integral output = sum of past errors (Ki * âˆ« error dt)
	â€¢	Derivative output = rate of change (Kd * d(error)/dt)
	5.	Combines the three terms to generate OUT
	6.	Applies output limiting, anti-windup, and optional manual control logic
	7.	Sends OUT to your actuator (e.g., control valve, pump, heater)

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What You Should Achieve
	â€¢	Achieve stable and accurate control of your process variable (e.g., temperature, pressure, flow)
	â€¢	Minimize overshoot, undershoot, and steady-state error
	â€¢	Allow for real-time adaptation and continuous process optimization
	â€¢	Easily re-tune or adapt PID parameters for new process requirements
	â€¢	Reduce manual adjustments and improve system reliability and safety
