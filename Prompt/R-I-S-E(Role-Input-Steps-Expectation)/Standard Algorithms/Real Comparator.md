**Real Comparator:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to compare two real inputs up to n decimal places. Include configurable precision and error handling.


**R-I-S-E:**

ğŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer tasked with developing a precision-controlled comparator function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for real-time industrial applications involving floating-point values.

ğŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are to implement a function block that:
	â€¢	Compares two REAL numbers (Input1, Input2)
	â€¢	Includes a configurable precision input (Precision : INT) to determine the number of decimal places for the comparison
	â€¢	Must return result flags:
	â€¢	Equal, Greater, Less, and Error
	â€¢	Should handle floating-point representation issues by rounding or scaling both values
	â€¢	Must validate inputs (e.g., check if Precision >= 0) and be safe to run in PLC scan-cycle environments

ğŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Declare input variables:
	â€¢	Input1, Input2 : REAL
	â€¢	Precision : INT
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL
	2.	Compute scaling factor:
	â€¢	Scale := POWER(10, Precision)
	3.	Scale and round inputs:
	â€¢	Rounded1 := REAL_TO_INT(Input1 * Scale)
	â€¢	Rounded2 := REAL_TO_INT(Input2 * Scale)
	4.	Compare results:
	â€¢	Set Equal := (Rounded1 = Rounded2)
	â€¢	Set Greater := (Rounded1 > Rounded2)
	â€¢	Set Less := (Rounded1 < Rounded2)
	5.	Handle errors:
	â€¢	If Precision < 0 or Enable = FALSE, set Error := TRUE
	6.	Add comments and guard conditions for clarity and safety

ğŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a self-contained, scan-safe function block that performs reliable REAL comparisons to a defined number of decimal places. This block should:
	â€¢	Prevent unexpected behavior due to floating-point inaccuracies
	â€¢	Be easily configurable and integrable into comparison-based PLC control logic
	â€¢	Provide clear diagnostic output (including error flags)
	â€¢	Enhance decision-making accuracy in quality checks, alarms, or control transitions
