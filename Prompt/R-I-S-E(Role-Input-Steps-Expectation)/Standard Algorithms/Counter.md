**Counter:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text for a digital counter with up/down counting modes. Include configurable initial value, step size, and overflow handling.


**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC programmer developing reusable function blocks in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for use in industrial automation systems.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You need to implement a digital counter function block that:
	â€¢	Supports both up and down counting modes
	â€¢	Accepts a configurable initial value and step size
	â€¢	Handles overflow and underflow conditions using MaxValue and MinValue limits
	â€¢	Includes a reset input to reinitialize the counter
	â€¢	Works efficiently in a scan-cycle PLC environment

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Define the function block interface with inputs:
	â€¢	Enable : BOOL
	â€¢	CountUp : BOOL
	â€¢	StepSize : INT
	â€¢	InitValue : INT
	â€¢	Reset : BOOL
	â€¢	MaxValue : INT
	â€¢	MinValue : INT
	2.	Use internal logic to:
	â€¢	Reset the counter when Reset = TRUE
	â€¢	Increase or decrease the counter based on CountUp and Enable
	â€¢	Clamp the value within MinValue and MaxValue to prevent overflows
	3.	Define outputs:
	â€¢	CurrentValue : INT
	â€¢	AtMax : BOOL
	â€¢	AtMin : BOOL
	4.	Add inline comments to explain each control mechanism and safeguard.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Deliver a robust, modular, and easy-to-use function block that enables configurable and safe digital counting in industrial environments. The block should be reusable, scan-cycle stable, and clear enough for other developers to maintain and integrate into larger control applications.
