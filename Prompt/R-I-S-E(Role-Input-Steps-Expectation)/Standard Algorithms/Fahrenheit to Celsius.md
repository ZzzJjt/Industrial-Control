**Fahrenheit to Celsius:**
Implement a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 structured text to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. Ensure it handles input validation and provides accurate results.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Define Your Role

Act as a PLC developer implementing utility function blocks in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text for safe and accurate temperature conversions within industrial automation systems.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ Information Provided

You are to build a function block that:
	â€¢	Accepts a temperature value in Fahrenheit
	â€¢	Converts it to Celsius using the standard formula
	â€¢	Includes input validation to reject values below absolute zero (âˆ’459.67Â°F)
	â€¢	Returns the Celsius temperature and a boolean flag indicating input validity
	â€¢	Ensures safety and accuracy during execution in scan-cycle-sensitive PLC environments

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ Steps to Perform
	1.	Define the function block interface with:
	â€¢	Fahrenheit : REAL (Input)
	â€¢	Celsius : REAL (Output)
	â€¢	ValidInput : BOOL (Output)
	2.	Implement input validation:
	â€¢	If Fahrenheit >= -459.67, proceed with conversion
	â€¢	Else, set Celsius := 0.0 and ValidInput := FALSE
	3.	Perform the conversion using the formula:
Celsius := (Fahrenheit - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
	4.	Include inline comments explaining the calculation and safety check
	5.	Test the block with edge values to confirm robustness

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ Expected Outcome

Produce a scan-cycle-safe, modular function block that performs accurate and validated Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion. The result should be suitable for use in control logic, HMI displays, or logging, and should improve both code reliability and reusability across PLC applications.
