**Feedforward Control Conveyor:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement feedforward control for adjusting the speed of a conveyor belt based on sensor-predicted load changes. The program should use input from sensors that predict the weight or volume of material entering the conveyor system, allowing for real-time adjustments to the belt speed before a load change occurs.

Include logic that calculates the required conveyor speed based on the predicted load and adjusts the motor speed accordingly, ensuring that the conveyor operates efficiently without overloading or underloading. Discuss the benefits of feedforward control in conveyor systems, particularly in reducing delays and improving response times compared to feedback-only control strategies.


**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are an industrial automation engineer responsible for programming a conveyor belt control system in a manufacturing plant. Your task is to implement a feedforward control strategy using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to proactively adjust conveyor speed based on predicted load input.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given
	â€¢	Predicted load value from an upstream sensor (e.g., Predicted_Load : REAL)
	â€¢	A base conveyor speed (e.g., Base_Speed := 1.0 m/s)
	â€¢	A feedforward gain (Gain_FF := 0.02) used to scale speed relative to the predicted load
	â€¢	Conveyor system operational limits (e.g., 0.5â€“2.0 m/s)
	â€¢	Conveyor motor controller expects a speed reference (Conveyor_Speed) as output

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Read the predicted load input
	â€¢	Capture upstream weight or volume data using a sensor
	2.	Calculate the conveyor speed using feedforward control
	â€¢	Formula: Conveyor_Speed := Base_Speed + Gain_FF * Predicted_Load
	3.	Limit the speed to safe operational bounds
	â€¢	Clamp values to avoid under-speeding or over-speeding:
	â€¢	IF Conveyor_Speed > 2.0 THEN Conveyor_Speed := 2.0
	â€¢	IF Conveyor_Speed < 0.5 THEN Conveyor_Speed := 0.5
	4.	Send the resulting speed to the motor controller

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

Your program will:
	â€¢	Dynamically adjust the conveyor speed based on future material inflow
	â€¢	Improve response time and reduce system lag compared to feedback-only designs
	â€¢	Prevent jams and underloads, maintaining optimal flow and system efficiency
	â€¢	Be modular, readable, and PLC-ready for deployment in real-time industrial environments

âœ… Example Code (Structured Text)

VAR
    Predicted_Load : REAL;         // kg or volume units
    Base_Speed : REAL := 1.0;      // m/s
    Gain_FF : REAL := 0.02;        // speed gain per unit load
    Conveyor_Speed : REAL;
END_VAR

// Calculate conveyor speed based on predicted load
Conveyor_Speed := Base_Speed + Gain_FF * Predicted_Load;

// Clamp speed to safety limits
IF Conveyor_Speed > 2.0 THEN
    Conveyor_Speed := 2.0;
ELSIF Conveyor_Speed < 0.5 THEN
    Conveyor_Speed := 0.5;
END_IF

// Output Conveyor_Speed to motor controller
