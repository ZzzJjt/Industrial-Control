**PID Flow Control Water Treatment:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback control for chemical dosing in a water treatment process. The program should regulate the dosing rate of chlorine at 3 ppm, adjusting based on real-time flow measurements with a sampling rate of 100 ms.

The control logic should include PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) that are tuned for maintaining the desired dosing concentration. Ensure the program accounts for any deviations from the setpoint and adjusts the chemical dosing accordingly, while including safety limits to prevent overdosing or underdosing. Discuss the importance of precise flow control in water treatment, with a focus on maintaining safe and effective chemical levels.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC control engineer responsible for implementing a PID feedback control loop for a chlorine dosing system in a water treatment plant. Your task is to ensure accurate chemical regulation under dynamic flow conditions using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given
	â€¢	Chlorine dosing target: 3 ppm (parts per million)
	â€¢	Real-time flow rate measurement (FlowRate)
	â€¢	Measured chlorine concentration (Dosing_PV)
	â€¢	Sampling rate: 100 ms
	â€¢	PID parameters:
	â€¢	Proportional gain Kp := 2.0
	â€¢	Integral gain Ki := 0.5
	â€¢	Derivative gain Kd := 0.1
	â€¢	Dosing output safety limits: min 0.0 to max 10.0

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Read the current flow rate and chlorine concentration from sensors.
	2.	Compute the error between the chlorine setpoint (3.0 ppm) and the measured value (Dosing_PV).
	3.	Apply the PID algorithm to calculate Dosing_Output using the sampled time (0.1 seconds).
	â€¢	Update the integral term with accumulated error
	â€¢	Calculate the derivative using the difference in error
	4.	Clamp the output within defined dosing limits for safety.
	5.	Send the result to control the dosing pump.

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

The program should:
	â€¢	Maintain precise dosing at 3 ppm under varying flow conditions
	â€¢	Respond quickly to deviations to prevent overdosing or underdosing
	â€¢	Be reliable and real-time capable on PLC hardware
	â€¢	Support compliance with water safety regulations and chemical efficiency
