**PID pH Control:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement PID feedback control for pH regulation in a process. The program should continuously adjust the addition of acid or base to maintain the pH setpoint, ensuring accurate control in dynamic conditions.

Include the PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) and the control logic to handle deviations from the target pH. The program should incorporate safeguards to prevent extreme pH levels by setting operational limits for the dosing mechanism. Discuss the challenges of pH control in industrial processes, particularly focusing on system response time, non-linear behavior of pH control, and maintaining process stability under varying input conditions.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are an industrial control engineer responsible for designing a PID control strategy in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to maintain stable pH levels in a process. Your program will regulate acid/base dosing to handle nonlinear behavior and ensure safety and precision.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given
	â€¢	pH_PV: Measured pH value from the sensor
	â€¢	pH_SP: Target setpoint (e.g., 7.0)
	â€¢	PID parameters:
	â€¢	Kp := 2.5 (Proportional gain)
	â€¢	Ki := 0.6 (Integral gain)
	â€¢	Kd := 0.3 (Derivative gain)
	â€¢	Cycle time: 100 ms
	â€¢	Dosing limits:
	â€¢	Dosing_Min := 0.0 (% output)
	â€¢	Dosing_Max := 100.0 (% output)

â¸»

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Calculate error: Error := pH_SP - pH_PV
	2.	Update integral term: Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1
	3.	Compute derivative: Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1
	4.	Calculate PID output:
Dosing_Output := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative)
	5.	Clamp dosing output within safe operating range:
	â€¢	If above Dosing_Max, set to max
	â€¢	If below Dosing_Min, set to min
	6.	Store current error as Prev_Error for the next cycle

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What You Should Achieve

Your program should:
	â€¢	Maintain stable and accurate pH in a dynamically changing process
	â€¢	Prevent overcorrection and unsafe pH excursions
	â€¢	React quickly to disturbances, especially near neutral pH where nonlinearity is high
	â€¢	Be robust, safe, and PLC-executable, suitable for integration into industrial water treatment, chemical mixing, or fermentation processes

VAR
    pH_PV : REAL;                      // Measured pH
    pH_SP : REAL := 7.0;               // pH setpoint

    // PID tuning
    Kp : REAL := 2.5;
    Ki : REAL := 0.6;
    Kd : REAL := 0.3;

    // Control variables
    Error : REAL;
    Prev_Error : REAL := 0.0;
    Integral : REAL := 0.0;
    Derivative : REAL;
    Dosing_Output : REAL;

    // Safety limits
    Dosing_Min : REAL := 0.0;
    Dosing_Max : REAL := 100.0;
END_VAR

// PID routine (sampled every 100 ms)
Error := pH_SP - pH_PV;
Integral := Integral + Error * 0.1;
Derivative := (Error - Prev_Error) / 0.1;

Dosing_Output := (Kp * Error) + (Ki * Integral) + (Kd * Derivative);

// Clamp output
IF Dosing_Output > Dosing_Max THEN
    Dosing_Output := Dosing_Max;
ELSIF Dosing_Output < Dosing_Min THEN
    Dosing_Output := Dosing_Min;
END_IF
