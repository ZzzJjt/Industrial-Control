**Cascade Control Oil Refinery:**

Develop a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program (not a function block) to implement cascade control for pressure regulation in an oil refinery vessel. The primary loop should control the vessel pressure, adjusting the pressure setpoint based on the process requirements. The secondary loop controls the flow of oil into the vessel, with the output of the primary loop serving as the setpoint for the secondary loop.

Ensure that the program manages the interaction between the two control loops, allowing the inner loop (oil flow control) to respond rapidly to changes in flow while the outer loop (pressure control) maintains overall process stability. Include typical parameter values for pressure and flow control, and discuss the benefits of cascade control in oil refinery operations, particularly for improving response time and process stability in systems with large disturbances.

**R-I-S-E:**

ðŸŸ¥ R (Role) â€“ Your Role

You are a PLC programmer working in an oil refinery setting. Your responsibility is to implement a cascade control system using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) to regulate the pressure in a process vessel by managing oil inflow.

ðŸŸ© I (Input) â€“ What Youâ€™re Given
	â€¢	Process Goal: Maintain vessel pressure at a desired setpoint using cascade control
	â€¢	Outer Loop:
	â€¢	Controls vessel pressure
	â€¢	Input: Pressure_SP (setpoint), Pressure_PV (measured pressure)
	â€¢	Output: Flow_SP (flow rate setpoint for inner loop)
	â€¢	Inner Loop:
	â€¢	Controls oil flow into the vessel
	â€¢	Input: Flow_SP (setpoint from outer loop), Flow_PV (measured flow)
	â€¢	Output: Flow_Output (actuator command)
	â€¢	Sample parameters:
	â€¢	Pressure_SP := 12.0 (bar)
	â€¢	Proportional gains: Kp_Outer := 1.2, Kp_Inner := 2.5

ðŸŸ§ S (Steps) â€“ What You Need to Do
	1.	Outer Loop: Pressure Controller
	â€¢	Calculate pressure error: Pressure_Error := Pressure_SP - Pressure_PV
	â€¢	Use proportional control to generate Flow_SP := Kp_Outer * Pressure_Error
	2.	Inner Loop: Flow Controller
	â€¢	Calculate flow error: Flow_Error := Flow_SP - Flow_PV
	â€¢	Use proportional control: Flow_Output := Kp_Inner * Flow_Error
	3.	Actuation
	â€¢	Send Flow_Output to the oil control valve or flow actuator
	4.	Execution Considerations
	â€¢	Run the inner loop faster than the outer loop for better responsiveness
	â€¢	Ensure clear variable names and maintainable structure

ðŸŸ¦ E (Expectation) â€“ What Success Looks Like

Your program will:
	â€¢	Maintain stable pressure in the vessel under dynamic load conditions
	â€¢	Allow the inner loop to react rapidly to disturbances in oil flow
	â€¢	Offer improved process control compared to single-loop systems
	â€¢	Be modular, clear, and ready for real-time deployment on a PLC

VAR
    // Outer loop: Pressure
    Pressure_SP : REAL := 12.0;
    Pressure_PV : REAL;
    Pressure_Error : REAL;
    Flow_SP : REAL;

    // Inner loop: Flow
    Flow_PV : REAL;
    Flow_Error : REAL;
    Flow_Output : REAL;

    // Controller gains
    Kp_Outer : REAL := 1.2;
    Kp_Inner : REAL := 2.5;
END_VAR

// Outer loop logic
Pressure_Error := Pressure_SP - Pressure_PV;
Flow_SP := Kp_Outer * Pressure_Error;

// Inner loop logic
Flow_Error := Flow_SP - Flow_PV;
Flow_Output := Kp_Inner * Flow_Error;

// Flow_Output controls oil inflow valve
