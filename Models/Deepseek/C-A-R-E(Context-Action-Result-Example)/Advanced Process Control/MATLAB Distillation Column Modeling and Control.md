To address the challenge of modeling and controlling a distillation column's dynamic behavior, especially considering the nonlinear relationship between feed rates and temperature, we will develop MATLAB code to create a dynamic mathematical model of a distillation column. Then, we'll implement a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme based on this model to optimize the distillation process while respecting system constraints.

Below is a simplified example of how you can approach this task in MATLAB:

### Step 1: Define the Plant Model

First, we define a linear state-space model for demonstration purposes. In practice, you would use a more detailed nonlinear model that accurately represents your distillation column.

```matlab
% Define the plant model - simplified for demonstration
A = [1 -0.5; 0 1]; % State matrix
B = [0; 1];        % Input matrix
C = [1 0];         % Output matrix
D = 0;             % Direct transmission matrix

% Create a continuous-time state-space model
sys = ss(A, B, C, D);

% Convert to discrete time with a sample time suitable for your application
Ts = 1; % Sample time (seconds)
sysd = c2d(sys, Ts);
```

### Step 2: Design MPC Controller

Next, we design an MPC controller using the `mpc` function from MATLAB's Model Predictive Control Toolbox. We set up the prediction and control horizons and specify weights for manipulated variables and output variables.

```matlab
% Setup MPC parameters
p = 10; % Prediction horizon
m = 3;  % Control horizon

% Create MPC object
mpcobj = mpc(sysd, Ts, p, m);

% Set weights for manipulated variables and output variables
mpcobj.Weights.ManipulatedVariablesRate = 0.1;
mpcobj.Weights.OutputVariables = [1];

% Constraint settings
mpcobj.MV.Min = -10; % Minimum input value
mpcobj.MV.Max = 10;  % Maximum input value
```

### Step 3: Simulate the System with MPC Control

We simulate the closed-loop system response under MPC control. For demonstration, we consider a step change in the reference signal and initial conditions.

```matlab
% Simulation settings
Tstop = 50; % Total simulation time
r = ones(Tstop, 1)*[0.5]; % Reference signal for output

% Initial states
x0 = [0; 0]; % Initial states

% Run closed-loop simulation without plotting or visualization
[y, t, u] = sim(mpcobj, Tstop, [], r, x0);

% Since plotting or visualization is not required, we omit those parts.
```

This code provides a basic framework for creating a dynamic model of a distillation column and implementing an MPC controller to manage its operation optimally. Note that in a real-world scenario, you should replace the simple linear model with a more accurate nonlinear model of your specific distillation column and adjust the MPC parameters accordingly to handle operational constraints and disturbances effectively. The provided script focuses on setting up the simulation environment and running the control strategy without including visual outputs as per your request.
