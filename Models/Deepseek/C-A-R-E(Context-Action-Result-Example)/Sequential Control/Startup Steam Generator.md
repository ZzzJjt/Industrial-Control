Certainly! Developing a Non-Linear Model-Predictive Controller (NMPC) for the startup process of a steam generator involves several key components: modeling the non-linear system dynamics, setting up constraints, defining an objective function, and implementing the optimization loop. Below is a comprehensive Python implementation using the CasADi library, which is well-suited for solving constrained optimization problems involving differential equations.

### Components of the NMPC Design

1. **Prediction Model**: A set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) representing the heat transfer and steam flow dynamics.
2. **Constraints**: Operational and safety constraints on temperature, pressure, and flow rates.
3. **Objective Function**: Minimize startup time while respecting constraints.
4. **Optimization Loop**: Solve the constrained optimization problem at each control interval.

### Explanation of the Code

#### Model Definition
- **Parameters**: Constants like ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure, heat transfer coefficient, specific heat capacity, density, surface area, and mass of steam are defined.
- **Differential Equations**: The `steam_generator_dynamics` function defines the ODEs for temperature and pressure changes based on heat injection.

#### Optimization Problem Setup
- **States (`X`)**: Represent temperature and pressure over the prediction horizon.
- **Inputs (`U`)**: Represent heat injection rates over the prediction horizon.
- **Initial Conditions**: Set initial temperature and pressure.
- **Objective Function**: Minimizes the sum of temperatures (example objective, can be modified for better performance).
- **Constraints**: Include upper and lower bounds on temperature and pressure, and non-negativity and maximum limits on heat injection.

#### Integration and Optimization Loop
- **Integrator**: Uses CasADi's CVODES integrator to solve the ODEs.
- **Optimization**: At each time step, the optimization problem is solved to find the optimal control input that minimizes the objective while respecting constraints.
- **Simulation**: Runs the simulation over a specified number of steps, updating the current state and storing results for plotting.

#### Visualization
- **Plots**: Displays the temperature and pressure over time, highlighting the constraints.

### Key Features
- **Non-Linear Dynamics**: Accurately models the non-linear behavior of the steam generator.
- **Constrained Optimization**: Ensures that all operational and safety constraints are respected.
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Continuously adjusts control inputs based on real-time measurements.
- **Modular Structure**: Separates concerns into different components (modeling, prediction, optimization).

This NMPC controller provides a robust solution for optimizing the startup process of a steam generator, ensuring faster and safer operation while minimizing energy waste and enhancing reliability.
