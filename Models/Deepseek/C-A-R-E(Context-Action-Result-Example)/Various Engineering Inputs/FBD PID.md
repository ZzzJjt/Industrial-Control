Certainly! Below is an ASCII-based Function Block Diagram (FBD) that includes an analog input block, a TON (on-delay) timer block, a PID control block, and an analog output block. The diagram shows the signal flow, block interconnections, and naming conventions used in PLC programming.

### Explanation of the Diagram

1. **Analog Input Block:**
   - **OUT=AI**: Output signal representing the analog input value from a sensor or transducer.

2. **TON (On-Delay Timer) Block:**
   - **IN=AI**: Input signal connected to the analog input (`AI`).
   - **ET=ET**: Elapsed time since the timer started.
   - **Q=Q**: Output signal indicating whether the timer has completed its delay.

3. **PID Control Block:**
   - **PV=AI**: Process variable input, which is the analog input value (`AI`).
   - **SP=SP**: Setpoint input, which is the desired process value (not shown as a direct connection but typically set externally).
   - **CV=CV**: Control variable output, which is the manipulated variable sent to the actuator.

4. **Analog Output Block:**
   - **IN=CV**: Input signal connected to the control variable (`CV`) from the PID controller.

### Signal Flow
- The **Analog Input** provides the `AI` signal to both the **TON Timer** and the **PID Controller**.
- The **PID Controller** uses the `AI` signal as the process variable (`PV`) and compares it with the setpoint (`SP`) to generate the control variable (`CV`).
- The **Control Variable** (`CV`) from the **PID Controller** is fed into the **Analog Output**, which then sends the appropriate signal to the actuator or final control element.

This ASCII FBD provides a clear textual representation of the control logic, making it easy to document, review, and share without the need for graphical tools.
