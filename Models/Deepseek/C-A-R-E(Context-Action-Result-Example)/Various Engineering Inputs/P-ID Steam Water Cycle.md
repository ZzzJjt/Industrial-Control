### Explanation of the Text-Based P&ID

- **Process Equipment:**
  - **Feedwater Tank (T01):** Stores feedwater before pumping.
  - **Pump (P02):** Increases pressure of feedwater.
  - **Boiler (B01):** Generates steam from feedwater.
  - **Steam Drum (D01):** Separates steam and water in the boiler.
  - **Condenser (C01):** Cools steam to form condensate.
  - **Deaerator (DA01):** Removes dissolved gases from feedwater.
  - **Feedwater Pump (P01):** Further increases pressure of deaerated feedwater.
  
- **Instrumentation:**
  - **FT101:** Measures feedwater flow rate.
  - **FIC101:** Controls feedwater flow rate.
  - **FCV101:** Regulates feedwater flow into the boiler.
  - **LT102:** Measures drum level.
  - **LIC102:** Controls drum level.
  - **LV102:** Regulates drum level by controlling blowdown.
  - **DT103:** Measures deaerator temperature.
  - **DTC103:** Controls deaerator temperature.
  - **DV103:** Regulates deaerator valve position.
  - **FT102:** Measures makeup water flow rate.
  - **FIC102:** Controls makeup water flow rate.
  - **FCV102:** Regulates makeup water flow into the deaerator.
  - **ST101:** Measures steam temperature.
  - **SPC101:** Controls steam temperature.
  - **SV101:** Regulates steam valves.
  - **BV105:** Allows controlled blowdown of boiler water.
  - **BT101:** Measures blowdown temperature.
  - **BLC101:** Controls blowdown level.
  - **BLV101:** Regulates blowdown level valve position.
  - **PT101:** Measures drum pressure.
  - **PC101:** Controls drum pressure.
  - **PV101:** Regulates pressure valve position.

- **Control Loops:**
  - **Feedwater Control Loop:** Ensures proper feedwater flow to the boiler.
  - **Drum Level Control Loop:** Maintains optimal drum level.
  - **Deaerator Temperature Control Loop:** Ensures proper deaeration.
  - **Makeup Water Control Loop:** Manages additional feedwater supply.
  - **Steam Temperature Control Loop:** Regulates steam temperature.
  - **Blowdown Control Loop:** Manages blowdown operations.
  - **Pressure Control Loop:** Maintains boiler drum pressure.

This text-based P&ID provides a clear and logical representation of the steam-water cycle, suitable for early-stage design discussions, control narrative development, and integration with PLC or DCS logic.
