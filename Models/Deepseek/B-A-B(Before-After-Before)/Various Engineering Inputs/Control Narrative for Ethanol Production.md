# 🧫 Ethanol Production Control Narrative

## 📋 Process Overview

Ethanol production involves several key stages:
1. **Feedstock Preparation** – Grinding, milling, and liquefaction of biomass
2. **Saccharification** – Enzymatic hydrolysis to convert starches into fermentable sugars
3. **Fermentation** – Microbial conversion of sugars to ethanol using yeast (e.g., *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*)
4. **Distillation & Dehydration** – Separation and purification of ethanol

This narrative focuses on **Section 3: Fermentation**, where precise control of temperature, pH, agitation, and timing ensures optimal microbial activity, product yield, and contamination prevention.

# 🟩 Section 3: Fermentation

## 🔹 3.1 Inoculation

The fermentation vessel must be sterilized before introducing the yeast culture. Sterilization is confirmed via temperature sensors (TSH-302) indicating that the vessel has reached and maintained 121 °C for at least 30 minutes. Once cooled to 30 °C, the inoculation valve opens automatically to introduce yeast slurry from the propagation tank. The dosing pump runs for a preset time to ensure consistent volume addition (typically 5–10% of batch volume). A level sensor confirms successful inoculation before proceeding to active fermentation.

```pascal
IF SterilizationComplete AND Temp < 31°C THEN
    Open(InoculationValve);
    Run(YeastPump, Duration := 60s); // Adjust based on batch size
END_IF;
```

## 🔹 3.2 Temperature Control

Maintaining an optimal fermentation temperature (32–35 °C, target = 34 °C) is critical for yeast viability and ethanol yield. A PID loop (TIC-301) controls the flow of cooling/heating water through the jacketed vessel using a modulating valve. If temperature exceeds 36 °C, a high-temperature alarm activates and triggers a slowdown in agitator speed to reduce metabolic heat generation. If temperature drops below 31 °C, heating begins until setpoint is reestablished.

```pascal
IF Temp > 36°C THEN
    RaiseAlarm("HighTemp");
    Reduce(AgitatorSpeed);
ELSIF Temp < 31°C THEN
    Activate(Heater);
ELSE
    Regulate(CoolingValve);
END_IF;
```

## 🔹 3.3 Agitation

Uniform mixing ensures even distribution of nutrients and oxygen during the aerobic phase and prevents hot spots or sedimentation. An agitator driven by a variable frequency drive (VFD) maintains a speed range of 60–120 RPM, typically set to 90 RPM during peak fermentation. Speed is adjusted based on dissolved oxygen feedback during early phases and reduced slightly as fermentation becomes anaerobic. A torque sensor monitors motor load; if it exceeds 90% of rated capacity for more than 10 seconds, an alarm flags potential mechanical issues.

```pascal
Setpoint_Agitator := 90 RPM;

IF DissolvedOxygen > Threshold THEN
    Increase(AgitatorSpeed);
ELSIF FermentationPhase = Anaerobic THEN
    Decrease(AgitatorSpeed, Target := 70 RPM);
END_IF;
```

---

## 🔹 3.4 pH Regulation

Yeast performs optimally in a pH range of 4.8–5.2. An inline pH analyzer (AIC-301) continuously measures the broth and adjusts acid/base dosing accordingly. If pH rises above 5.2, citric acid is added via peristaltic pump until correction. If pH drops below 4.8, sodium hydroxide is dosed. Alarms are triggered if pH remains outside this range for more than 10 minutes or if dosing pumps fail to respond.

```pascal
IF pH > 5.2 THEN
    Start(AcidDosingPump);
ELSIF pH < 4.8 THEN
    Start(BaseDosingPump);
END_IF;

// Alarm condition
IF pH < 4.8 OR pH > 5.2 FOR T#10m THEN
    RaiseAlarm("pHOutOfRange");
END_IF;
```

---

## 🔹 3.5 Fermentation Completion

Fermentation is considered complete when either:
- Residual sugar concentration falls below 2 g/L (measured by inline refractometer), or
- CO₂ off-gas flow rate drops below 1 L/min/kg broth for 30 consecutive minutes

At this point, the transfer pump starts, and the fermented broth is moved to the distillation column. A final sample is taken for offline quality verification before transfer.

```pascal
IF SugarLevel < 2g/L OR CO2FlowRate < 1 L/min/kg FOR T#30m THEN
    Stop(Agitator);
    Close(InletValves);
    Open(TransferValve);
    Start(TransferPump);
END_IF;
```

## ⚠️ Emergency Shutdown Conditions

Trigger emergency shutdown if any of the following occur:
- Temperature > 38 °C
- pH < 4.5 or > 5.5 for over 10 minutes
- Agitator failure detected (torque overload or stoppage)
- Cooling system failure
- Operator presses E-stop

```pascal
IF Temp > 38 OR pH < 4.5 OR pH > 5.5 FOR T#10m OR AgitatorFault THEN
    TriggerEmergencyShutdown();
END_IF;
```

During ESD:
- All pumps and agitators stop
- Inlet valves close
- Transfer valve opens to safety tank if possible
- Alarm logs event and notifies control room
