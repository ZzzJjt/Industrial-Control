To achieve the desired outcome of creating a comprehensive list of mathematical function blocks available in the OSCAT library, we will organize these into categories and provide brief descriptions along with typical use cases. Please note that due to the limitation of real-time access to external databases or specific documentation, this list is based on general knowledge about what such libraries usually contain. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, always refer directly to the latest OSCAT library documentation.

## üìò Mathematical Function Blocks in OSCAT Library

### üìä Trigonometric Functions
- **Sine (SIN)**
  - Description: Calculates the sine of an angle.
  - Use Case: Used in calculations involving angles, often found in motion control applications.
  
- **Cosine (COS)**
  - Description: Calculates the cosine of an angle.
  - Use Case: Similar to SIN but used for different aspects of angular calculations.
  
- **Tangent (TAN)**
  - Description: Computes the tangent of an angle.
  - Use Case: Useful for determining slopes or rates of change in periodic processes.

### üî¢ Statistical Functions
- **Mean Value (MEAN)**
  - Description: Computes the average value from a set of inputs.
  - Use Case: Commonly used in data analysis for process optimization.
  
- **Standard Deviation (STDDEV)**
  - Description: Measures dispersion or spread within a dataset.
  - Use Case: Helps in quality control by assessing variability in production outputs.
  
- **Root Mean Square (RMS)**
  - Description: Calculates the RMS value of a signal.
  - Use Case: Often applied in electrical engineering for analyzing AC signals.

### ‚ûï Algebraic Functions
- **Addition (ADD)**
  - Description: Adds two or more values together.
  - Use Case: Basic arithmetic operation used across all types of calculations.
  
- **Subtraction (SUB)**
  - Description: Subtracts one value from another.
  - Use Case: Used in difference calculations, like error calculation in PID controllers.
  
- **Multiplication (MUL)**
  - Description: Multiplies two or more values.
  - Use Case: Widely used in scaling operations and formula computations.
  
- **Division (DIV)**
  - Description: Divides one value by another.
  - Use Case: Essential for ratio calculations and normalization tasks.

### üìà Advanced Mathematical Operations
- **Exponential (EXP)**
  - Description: Calculates e raised to the power of x.
  - Use Case: Found in growth models and decay calculations.
  
- **Logarithm (LOG)**
  - Description: Computes the logarithm of a number.
  - Use Case: Useful in converting multiplicative relationships into additive ones, aiding in analysis.
  
- **Power (POW)**
  - Description: Raises a base number to an exponent.
  - Use Case: Applies in various formulas where exponential relationships are modeled.

### üîÑ Conversion Functions
- **Degrees to Radians (DEG_TO_RAD)**
  - Description: Converts degrees to radians.
  - Use Case: Necessary conversion before using trigonometric functions if input is in degrees.
  
- **Radians to Degrees (RAD_TO_DEG)**
  - Description: Converts radians to degrees.
  - Use Case: Converts output from trigonometric functions back to degrees for easier interpretation.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
For each function block, ensure to check the parameter types supported (e.g., REAL, INT), any limitations on range, and whether there are special considerations for handling edge cases or errors.

This table format provides a quick overview and serves as a starting point for engineers looking to integrate advanced math operations into their automation projects using the OSCAT library. Always consult the official OSCAT documentation for detailed specifications and examples tailored to your specific application needs.
