Equipment:
- C-101: Distillation Column
- E-101: Reboiler
- E-102: Condenser

Sensors:
- PT-101: Pressure Transmitter on C-101
- TT-101: Temperature Transmitter on C-101
- LT-101: Level Transmitter on Reflux Drum (connected to top of C-101)

Actuators:
- FV-101: Feed Valve controlling feed into C-101
- PRV-101: Pressure Relief Valve on C-101

Control Loops:
- PT-101 monitors pressure in C-101; controls PRV-101 for overpressure protection.
- TT-101 monitors temperature in C-101; used to control heat input to E-101.
- LT-101 monitors level in reflux drum; used for level control and safety interlocks.
- FV-101 regulates feed flow into C-101 based on process requirements and safety interlocks.
