# ðŸ“˜ **OSCAT Mathematical Function Blocks â€“ Quick Reference Guide**

This guide organizes the most commonly used **mathematical function blocks** from the **OSCAT (Open Source Controller Automation Toolkit)** library. It is designed to help PLC developers and automation engineers quickly locate and apply the right function block for control, data processing, or industrial math tasks.
