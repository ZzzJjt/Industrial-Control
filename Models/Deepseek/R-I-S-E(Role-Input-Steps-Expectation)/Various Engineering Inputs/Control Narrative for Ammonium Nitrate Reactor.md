#### 3. Operating Procedures

##### 3.1 Startup Procedure
1. **Preparation**:
   - Ensure all valves are closed.
   - Verify that all instruments (TIC-101, PIC-102, FIC-103, FIC-104, AIC-105) are calibrated and functioning properly.
   - Confirm that the jacket heating system is ready.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Open the inlet valve for ammonia and nitric acid.
   - Initialize the jacket heating system to gradually raise the reactor temperature.

3. **Ramp Up Flows**:
   - Slowly increase the flow rates of ammonia and nitric acid to their respective setpoints (FIC-103 and FIC-104).
   - Monitor the temperature and pressure using TIC-101 and PIC-102.
   - Adjust flows as necessary to maintain setpoints.

4. **Stabilization**:
   - Once stable conditions are achieved, ensure all setpoints are within acceptable ranges.
   - Begin monitoring pH using AIC-105 and make adjustments if necessary.

##### 3.2 Normal Operation
1. **Maintain Setpoints**:
   - Use PID controllers (TIC-101 and PIC-102) to maintain temperature and pressure within setpoints.
   - Continuously monitor ammonia and nitric acid flow rates (FIC-103 and FIC-104) to maintain the correct ratio (1.01:1).

2. **Monitor pH**:
   - Regularly check the pH level using AIC-105.
   - Adjust feed ratios if necessary to keep pH within the acceptable range (5.8–6.5).

3. **Safety Monitoring**:
   - Continuously monitor for any deviations from setpoints or abnormal conditions.
   - Respond immediately to any alarms or interlocks triggered by safety systems.

##### 3.3 Shutdown Procedure
1. **Stop Feeds**:
   - Gradually reduce and then stop the flow rates of ammonia and nitric acid (FIC-103 and FIC-104).

2. **Vent Pressure**:
   - Safely vent the reactor pressure using PIC-102.

3. **Cool Reactor**:
   - Gradually cool the reactor using the jacket cooling system.

4. **Close Valves**:
   - Close all inlet and outlet valves to isolate the reactor.

5. **Final Checks**:
   - Ensure all systems are safely shut down and no residual chemicals remain in the reactor.

#### 4. Safety Interlocks and Alarm Triggers

##### 4.1 Emergency Shutdown (ESD) Conditions
- **Temperature > 185°C**: Trigger ESD to stop all feeds and vent pressure.
- **Pressure > 5.2 bar**: Trigger ESD to stop all feeds and vent pressure.
- **pH < 5.5**: Trigger ESD to stop all feeds and vent pressure.

##### 4.2 Alarms and Lockouts
- **Temperature Deviation**:
  - Alarm if Temp > 180°C or Temp < 170°C.
  - Lockout if Temp > 185°C or Temp < 170°C.
  
- **Pressure Deviation**:
  - Alarm if Pressure > 5.0 bar or Pressure < 4.5 bar.
  - Lockout if Pressure > 5.2 bar or Pressure < 4.5 bar.
  
- **Flow Ratio Deviation**:
  - Alarm if Ammonia/Acid Ratio deviates ±10% from target (1.01:1).
  - Lockout if Ammonia/Acid Ratio deviates ±15% from target (1.01:1).
  
- **pH Deviation**:
  - Alarm if pH < 5.8 or pH > 6.5.
  - Lockout if pH < 5.5 or pH > 6.8.
  
- **Level Sensor**:
  - High-Level Alarm if LSH-106 activated.
  - Lockout if LSH-106 activated.
