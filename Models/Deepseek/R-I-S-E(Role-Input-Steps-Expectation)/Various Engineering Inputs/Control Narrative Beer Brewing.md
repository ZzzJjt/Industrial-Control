- **Key Parameters**:
  - **Carbonation Levels**: Based on recipe (e.g., 2.5 volumes CO₂)
  - **Pasteurization Temperature**: 65–70°C (optional, based on recipe)

#### 3. Detailed Control Narrative

##### 3.1 Mashing Stage
- **Step-by-Step Sequence**:
  1. Heat water to target temperature.
  2. Mix hot water with crushed grain in mash tun.
  3. Maintain temperature for specified time using heat exchanger.
  4. Stir periodically to prevent clumping.
  5. Record pH levels and adjust if necessary.

##### 3.2 Lautering Stage
- **Required Equipment and Instrumentation**:
  - **Equipment**: Lauter tun, rake mechanism, sparge arm, pump
  - **Instrumentation**: Level sensor, turbidity meter, flow transmitter, temperature probe

- **Step-by-Step Operational Sequence**:
  1. **Start Recirculation Loop**:
     - Activate pump to circulate wort within the lauter tun.
     - Continue recirculating until the wort runs clear.
  
  2. **Monitor Turbidity**:
     - Continuously monitor turbidity using a turbidity meter.
     - Divert flow to waste if turbidity exceeds threshold (e.g., > 5 NTU).
  
  3. **Begin Wort Transfer to Kettle**:
     - Once turbidity is below threshold, open valve to transfer wort to kettle.
     - Monitor flow rate using flow transmitter.
  
  4. **Start Sparge Water Flow**:
     - Begin pumping sparge water into the lauter tun at a controlled rate.
     - Ensure sparge water temperature is maintained (75–78°C).
  
  5. **Maintain Level**:
     - Use level sensor to maintain lauter tun level within acceptable range (20–40 cm).
     - Stop sparge water if level falls below minimum (20 cm).
  
  6. **Monitor Volume, Flow Rate, and Turbidity**:
     - Continuously monitor total volume transferred using flow transmitter.
     - Ensure flow rate remains within setpoint (2–4 L/min).
     - Monitor turbidity to ensure wort clarity.
  
  7. **End Lautering**:
     - Cease sparging once target volume is met and wort clarity is acceptable.
     - Close valves and shut down pump.

- **Control Logic**:
  - **IF Turbidity > Limit THEN divert flow to waste**
  - **IF Level < Minimum THEN stop sparge water**

##### 3.3 Boiling Stage
- **Step-by-Step Sequence**:
  1. Transfer wort from kettle to boiler.
  2. Heat wort to boiling point (98–100°C).
  3. Add hops according to schedule.
  4. Maintain boiling for specified time.
  5. Cool wort to fermentation temperature using heat exchanger.

##### 3.4 Fermentation Stage
- **Step-by-Step Sequence**:
  1. Transfer cooled wort to fermentor.
  2. Pitch yeast and aerate wort.
  3. Maintain fermentation temperature using cooling jacket.
  4. Monitor fermentation progress daily.
  5. Transfer to secondary fermentor if necessary.

##### 3.5 Packaging Stage
- **Step-by-Step Sequence**:
  1. Transfer fermented beer to bottling line or kegging station.
  2. Carbonate beer to desired level.
  3. Pasteurize beer if required (65–70°C).
  4. Fill bottles or kegs.
  5. Seal containers and label.

#### 4. Integration into PLC/HMI Systems
- **PLC Configuration**:
  - **Inputs**: Start, Stop buttons; sensors (level, turbidity, flow, temperature).
  - **Outputs**: Pumps, valves, heaters, coolers.
  - **Control Algorithms**: PID controllers for temperature regulation; logic for turbidity monitoring and diversion.

- **HMI Screens**:
  - **Dashboard**: Real-time display of key parameters (temperature, turbidity, flow rate, level).
  - **Alarm System**: Alerts for deviations from setpoints.
  - **Log Viewer**: Historical data logging for troubleshooting and quality assurance.

#### 5. Operator Training Materials
