Certainly! Below is a structured, text-based System Control Diagram (SCD) for an LNG vaporizer system in compliance with NORSOK standards. The diagram includes the process flow, instrumentation, control loops, interlocks, and shutdown logic.

### LNG Vaporizer System Control Diagram

#### Process Flow Path
```
LNG_INLET --> FT201 --> FIC201 --> FCV201 --> VAPORIZER --> TT101 --> TIC101 --> TCV101 --> GAS_OUTLET
```

#### Instrumentation and Control Loops

##### Flow Control Loop
```
FT201 (Flow Transmitter) --> FIC201 (Flow Controller) --> FCV201 (Flow Control Valve)
```
- **FT201**: Measures the flow rate of LNG entering the system.
- **FIC201**: Controls the flow rate to maintain the desired setpoint.
- **FCV201**: Adjusts the flow of LNG based on the controller's output.

##### Temperature Control Loop
```
TT101 (Temperature Transmitter) --> TIC101 (Temperature Controller) --> TCV101 (Temperature Control Valve)
```
- **TT101**: Measures the temperature of the gas leaving the vaporizer.
- **TIC101**: Controls the temperature to maintain the desired setpoint.
- **TCV101**: Adjusts the flow of gas to regulate the temperature.

#### Interlock Logic

##### High-Pressure Trip
```
PSH301 (High-Pressure Switch) --> ESD1 (Emergency Shutdown) --> TCV101 (Close TCV101)
```
- **PSH301**: Detects high pressure in the system.
- **ESD1**: Initiates emergency shutdown if high pressure is detected.
- **TCV101**: Closes the temperature control valve to stop gas flow.

##### High-Temperature Trip
```
TSH302 (High-Temperature Switch) --> ESD2 (Block LNG Inlet) --> LNG_INLET (Block LNG Inlet)
```
- **TSH302**: Detects high temperature in the system.
- **ESD2**: Blocks the LNG inlet if high temperature is detected.
- **LNG_INLET**: Stops the flow of LNG into the system.

### Detailed Explanation of Components and Instruments

#### Process Flow Path
- **LNG_INLET**: Point where LNG enters the system.
- **GAS_OUTLET**: Point where vaporized gas exits the system.

#### Flow Control Loop
- **FT201**: Measures the flow rate of LNG entering the system.
- **FIC201**: Controls the flow rate to ensure it meets the desired setpoint.
- **FCV201**: Regulates the flow of LNG based on the controller's output.

#### Temperature Control Loop
- **TT101**: Measures the temperature of the gas leaving the vaporizer.
- **TIC101**: Controls the temperature to ensure it meets the desired setpoint.
- **TCV101**: Regulates the flow of gas to maintain the desired temperature.

#### Interlock Logic
- **PSH301**: High-pressure switch that detects excessive pressure in the system.
- **ESD1**: Emergency shutdown logic that closes the temperature control valve (TCV101) when high pressure is detected.
- **TSH302**: High-temperature switch that detects excessively high temperatures in the system.
- **ESD2**: Emergency shutdown logic that blocks the LNG inlet when high temperature is detected.

This structured, text-based SCD provides a clear and detailed map of the LNG vaporizer system, including all major unit operations, instrumentation, control loops, and safety interlocks. It supports functional specification, engineering reviews, DCS/PLC logic design, and safety documentation and compliance verification.
