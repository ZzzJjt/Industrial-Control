### Overall Process Structure

The PVC production process involves the following stages:
1. **Polymerize**: Evacuate the reactor, charge it with demineralized water and surfactants, initiate polymerization by adding VCM and catalyst, maintain temperature between 55–60°C, and monitor pressure drop.
2. **Decover**: Prepare the system for material release or transfer.
3. **Dry**: Finalize the process by removing residual moisture.

#### Required Materials

### Structured Text (ST) Program



### Explanation of the Code

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - `StartButton`: Initiates the start of the mixing process.
   - `StopButton`: Stops the mixing process prematurely.
   - `EmergencyStop`: Stops the machine immediately and safely.
   - `VacuumPumpActive`: Output to control the vacuum pump.
   - `ValveDemineralizedWater`, `ValveSurfactants`, `ValveVCM`, `ValveCatalyst`: Valves for respective ingredients.
   - `HeaterActive`, `CoolerActive`: Outputs to control the heater and cooler.
   - `AgitatorSpeed`: Output to control the agitator speed.

2. **Internal Variables**:
   - `CurrentPhase`: Tracks the current phase of the process (0 = Idle, 1 = Polymerize, 2 = Decover, 3 = Dry).
   - `Running`: Indicates whether the process is running.
   - `EmergencyStopped`: Indicates whether an emergency stop has occurred.
   - `TargetTemperatureMin`, `TargetTemperatureMax`: Desired temperature range for polymerization.
   - `TargetAgitatorSpeed`: Desired agitator speed.
   - `PressureSetpoint`: Pressure setpoint for monitoring.
   - `TimerEvacuation`, `TimerCharging`, `TimerPolymerization`, `TimerDecovering`, `TimerDrying`: Timers for each phase.
   - `CurrentTemperature`, `CurrentPressure`: Simulated readings from sensors.

3. **Initialization**:
   - All outputs are initialized to their default states (e.g., valves closed, heater and cooler off, agitator speed zero).

4. **Main Control Loop**:
   - Handles emergency stops by deactivating all components and resetting flags.
   - Manages transitions between phases based on inputs and conditions.

5. **Phase Control Logic**:
   - **Polymerize Phase**:
     - **Evacuation**: Activates the vacuum pump and evacuates the reactor for 30 minutes.
     - **Charging**: Opens valves for demineralized water, surfactants, VCM, and catalyst, charging them sequentially for 10 minutes each.
     - **Maintain Temperature**: Maintains the temperature between 55–60°C using heaters and coolers. Monitors pressure drop and handles excessive pressure by stopping the process.
   - **Decover Phase**: Reduces agitation speed and prepares the system for material release or transfer for 15 minutes.
   - **Dry Phase**: Heats the material and maintains the temperature between 55–60°C to remove residual moisture for 1 hour.

6. **Modular Methods**:
   - `EvacuateReactor()`: Activates the vacuum pump and evacuates the reactor for 30 minutes.
   - `AddDemineralizedWater()`: Opens the valve for demineralized water and charges it for 10 minutes.
   - `AddSurfactants()`: Opens the valve for surfactants and charges them for 10 minutes.
   - `AddVCMAndCatalyst()`: Opens the valves for VCM and catalyst and charges them for 10 minutes.
   - `MaintainTemperature()`: Controls the heater and cooler to maintain the temperature within the specified range and monitors pressure.
   - `DecoverSystem()`: Reduces agitation speed and prepares the system for material release or transfer for 15 minutes.
   - `DryMaterial()`: Heats the material and maintains the temperature within the specified range to remove residual moisture for 1 hour.
