### Explanation

#### Traceability and Safety Logic Design
- **Traceability**: The matrix provides a clear visual link between potential hazards and their corresponding safety actions, making it easier to trace and verify safety logic.
- **Safety Logic Design**: By mapping each cause to specific safety actions, engineers can systematically design and validate interlock logic, ensuring that all hazardous conditions are addressed.

#### Robust Fault Detection and Interlock Activation
- **Overpressure**: Triggers shutting valves, activating emergency cooling, isolating feeds, initiating shutdown sequence, sending alarm signals, logging events, and notifying operators.
- **Underheating**: Triggers activating emergency cooling, isolating feeds, sending alarm signals, logging events, and notifying operators.
- **Process Failure**: Triggers shutting valves, activating emergency cooling, isolating feeds, initiating shutdown sequence, sending alarm signals, logging events, and notifying operators.
- **Sensor Failures**: Depending on the type of sensor failure (temperature or pressure), specific safety actions such as activating emergency cooling, isolating feeds, sending alarm signals, logging events, and notifying operators are triggered.
- **Equipment Malfunctions**: Triggers shutting valves, activating emergency cooling, isolating feeds, initiating shutdown sequence, de-energizing equipment, isolating power supplies, engaging backup systems, sending alarm signals, logging events, and notifying operators.
- **Communication Failures**: Triggers isolating feeds, sending alarm signals, logging events, isolating power supplies, and notifying operators.
- **Power Outage**: Triggers isolating feeds, initiating shutdown sequence, de-energizing equipment, isolating power supplies, engaging backup systems, sending alarm signals, logging events, and notifying operators.
- **Control System Failure**: Triggers shutting valves, activating emergency cooling, isolating feeds, initiating shutdown sequence, de-energizing equipment, isolating power supplies, engaging backup systems, sending alarm signals, logging events, and notifying operators.
- **Human Error**: Triggers shutting valves, activating emergency cooling, isolating feeds, initiating shutdown sequence, sending alarm signals, logging events, and notifying operators.
- **External Environmental Factors**: Triggers shutting valves, activating emergency cooling, isolating feeds, sending alarm signals, logging events, and notifying operators.

This matrix ensures that each hazardous condition in the chemical reactor's interlock system triggers at least one appropriate safety action, thereby enhancing operational safety, reducing risk, and ensuring regulatory compliance in process control environments.
