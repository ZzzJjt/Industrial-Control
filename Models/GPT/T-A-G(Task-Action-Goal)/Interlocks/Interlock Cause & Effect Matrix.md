Explanation

This cause and effect matrix defines the interlock logic linking hazardous reactor conditions to immediate protective actions. Each row describes a specific process anomaly or failure mode that could pose safety or operational risks. The matrix maps these causes to effects that include alarms, equipment shutdowns, valve isolations, and activation of auxiliary safety systems.
	•	High Reactor Pressure triggers all available protective measures, as overpressure poses a critical risk of vessel rupture.
	•	Low Reactor Level prevents dry-run damage by stopping feed pumps and isolating the process.
	•	High Reactor Temperature demands both heat source isolation and emergency cooling to prevent runaway reactions.
	•	Cooling Failure or Heater Overcurrent isolates the heating system to prevent thermal damage.
	•	Mechanical or control failures like Agitator Motor Failure and PLC Communication Failure result in full interlock activation to prevent loss of control.

By mapping causes to effects in a traceable format, this matrix enhances design transparency and supports verification of interlock logic during commissioning, operation, and safety audits. It helps operators and engineers rapidly understand the rationale behind shutdowns and ensures that appropriate mitigation steps are always taken to safeguard personnel, equipment, and the process itself.
