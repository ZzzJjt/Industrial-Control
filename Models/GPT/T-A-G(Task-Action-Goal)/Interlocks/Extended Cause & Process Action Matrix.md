Matrix Usage Explanation

This cause-and-action matrix provides a systematic link between hazardous conditions (causes) and safety responses (actions) in the reactor’s interlock logic. Each row identifies a specific failure or deviation, while each column denotes a process action enforced through interlock logic.

Key Benefits:
	•	Traceability: Engineers can trace each safety action back to its initiating cause, aiding validation and audit.
	•	Clarity: Simplifies HAZOP reviews, P&ID interlock mapping, and logic verification.
	•	Reliability: Ensures every critical hazard (e.g., overpressure, underheating, equipment fault) triggers at least one mitigating response.
	•	Redundancy & Robustness: Overlapping actions (e.g., shut valves + alarm) provide layered defense against single-point failures.

Application:
	•	Used during safety system design and FAT (Factory Acceptance Test) to validate cause-response coverage.
	•	Integrated with PLC or SIS logic to auto-generate logic blocks based on mapped relationships.
	•	Supports SIL/IEC 61511 compliance by ensuring consistent and defendable safety response mapping.
