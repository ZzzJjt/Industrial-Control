üìå What‚Äôs New in IEC 61499?

1. Event-Driven Execution
	‚Ä¢	IEC 61499 introduces event-based triggering for logic execution.
	‚Ä¢	Function blocks execute only when triggered by an event, making control more responsive and scalable.
	‚Ä¢	Contrast: 61131-3 relies on cyclic scan execution‚Äîevery logic rung or block is evaluated in every scan.

2. Function Blocks with Event/Data Interfaces
	‚Ä¢	IEC 61499 separates function block interfaces into:
	‚Ä¢	Event inputs/outputs (to trigger execution),
	‚Ä¢	Data inputs/outputs (used in computation).
	‚Ä¢	This leads to clearer control logic and better encapsulation.

3. Designed for Distribution
	‚Ä¢	Systems are natively distributed: function blocks can reside and execute across multiple networked devices.
	‚Ä¢	Supports peer-to-peer communication, unlike 61131-3 which is tightly bound to single controllers.

üîç Comparison: IEC 61131-3 vs. IEC 61499

üöÄ Why It Matters for Industry 4.0
	‚Ä¢	Edge computing: Deploy intelligence close to sensors/actuators.
	‚Ä¢	Plug-and-play reconfiguration: Reuse components without platform lock-in.
	‚Ä¢	Cloud-ready: Enables integration with monitoring, analytics, and optimization layers.
	‚Ä¢	Modularity: Systems become easier to maintain and scale.
