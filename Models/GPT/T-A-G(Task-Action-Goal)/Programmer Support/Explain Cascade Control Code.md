‚úÖ Primary Loop ‚Äì Pressure Control (Outer Loop)
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: Maintain stable vessel pressure.
	‚Ä¢	How it works:
	‚Ä¢	Reads the actual vessel pressure:
PV1 := ReadPressure();
	‚Ä¢	Compares it to a fixed pressure setpoint:
SP1 := Desired_Pressure;
	‚Ä¢	Computes error: Error1 := SP1 - PV1
	‚Ä¢	Applies PID (with gains Kp1, Ki1, Kd1):
	‚Ä¢	Integral and derivative terms updated using fixed sample time dt
	‚Ä¢	Output OP1 becomes the setpoint for the inner flow loop:
	‚Ä¢	SP2 := OP1
	‚Ä¢	Clamped to ensure output remains within valid limits (0‚Äì100%)

‚úÖ Secondary Loop ‚Äì Flow Control (Inner Loop)
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: React quickly to achieve target flow rate (SP2), compensating for disturbances.
	‚Ä¢	How it works:
	‚Ä¢	Reads real-time flow rate:
PV2 := ReadFlowRate();
	‚Ä¢	Compares it to the new flow setpoint (from pressure loop):
SP2 := OP1
	‚Ä¢	Computes error: Error2 := SP2 - PV2
	‚Ä¢	Applies PID control (with Kp2, Ki2, Kd2)
	‚Ä¢	Output OP2 controls actuator directly:
	‚Ä¢	SetValvePosition(OP2);
	‚Ä¢	Again clamped (0‚Äì100%) for safety and actuator integrity.

‚è± Timing Considerations
	‚Ä¢	Both loops use a fixed sample time:
	‚Ä¢	dt := t#100ms
	‚Ä¢	Inner loop (flow) reacts faster and more frequently than the outer (pressure), as is standard in cascade control architecture.

üéØ What This Cascade Control Achieves
	‚Ä¢	Fast correction of disturbances in flow before they propagate to pressure
	‚Ä¢	Tighter, more stable pressure control by leveraging a responsive inner loop
	‚Ä¢	Robust safety with clamping for both valve and controller outputs
	‚Ä¢	Modular structure, making it ideal for expansion (e.g., SCADA interface, tuning mode)
