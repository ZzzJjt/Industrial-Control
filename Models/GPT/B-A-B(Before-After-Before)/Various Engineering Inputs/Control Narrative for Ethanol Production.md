**3.1 Inoculation**  
After sterilization of the fermenter and cooling to 34â€¯Â°C, yeast inoculum is added at 5% of total working volume. The addition is automated via a dosing pump, interlocked to ensure inoculation only occurs once the fermenter temperature is within Â±1â€¯Â°C of the setpoint and pressure is below 0.5â€¯bar. A time delay ensures 10 minutes of post-inoculation mixing before transitioning to the active fermentation phase.

**3.2 Temperature Control**  
Fermenter temperature is maintained at 34â€¯Â°C using a jacketed vessel connected to a temperature control loop. A PID controller (TIC-302) regulates the flow of glycol-cooled water through a control valve based on input from a PT100 RTD sensor (TT-302). Alarms are triggered if temperature deviates more than Â±2â€¯Â°C, and emergency cooling activates above 37â€¯Â°C.

**3.3 Agitation**  
Agitation is achieved using a variable frequency drive (VFD)-controlled agitator motor (MTR-303). The speed is initially set at 90 RPM and may be adjusted based on operator input or dissolved oxygen trends. The agitator runs continuously during fermentation, ensuring homogeneous conditions and preventing COâ‚‚ buildup. Agitator failure triggers an alarm and pauses acid/base dosing.

**3.4 pH Regulation**  
Inline pH measurement (pH-304) feeds real-time data to a PID pH controller (AIC-301), which regulates acid (Hâ‚‚SOâ‚„) or base (NaOH) dosing pumps. The target range is 4.8â€“5.2. Dosing valves are interlocked to prevent overdosing (>5â€¯L/h) and are disabled if the pH sensor fails self-diagnostics or agitator is stopped.

**3.5 Fermentation Completion**  
Fermentation is monitored via a COâ‚‚ off-gas flowmeter (FT-305) and optionally by inline ethanol concentration measurement (AIT-306). When the COâ‚‚ flow rate drops below 0.1â€¯L/min for 30 minutes, or ethanol concentration exceeds 12% v/v, a transfer-to-holding-tank sequence is triggered. This includes stopping agitation, initiating jacket cooling to 20â€¯Â°C, and opening the bottom drain valve. An operator acknowledgment is required before transfer completes.
