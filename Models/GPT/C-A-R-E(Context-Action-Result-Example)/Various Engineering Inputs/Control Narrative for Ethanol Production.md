3.1 Inoculation

The fermentation process begins with the inoculation of the fermenter using a prepared yeast slurry. The control objective is to introduce the yeast into a nutrient-rich mash under sterile and anaerobic conditions. The inoculation pump is interlocked with a batch confirmation signal and a tank-level switch to ensure the mash is at least 80% full. The inoculation temperature must be within the 30–33 °C range before yeast is added. A one-time injection is confirmed by a flow totalizer (FT-301), after which the inoculation valve closes automatically. An operator acknowledgment is required to proceed.

3.2 Temperature Control

Temperature during fermentation is maintained within 32–35 °C to support optimal yeast activity. A jacketed fermenter is equipped with a PT100 temperature sensor and a motorized cooling water valve controlled via a PID loop (TIC-302). The control system continuously monitors fermenter temperature and adjusts cooling water flow to counter exothermic heat from fermentation. If temperature exceeds 35.5 °C, a high-temperature alarm is activated. A critical high interlock halts fermentation and closes all feed valves at 36 °C to prevent irreversible enzyme denaturation and yeast stress.

3.3 pH Regulation

pH is automatically regulated within the range of 4.5–5.0 using a pH transmitter (AIC-303) located in the fermenter. When pH drops below 4.5, an alkaline dosing pump injects sodium hydroxide solution via a controlled valve. If pH exceeds 5.0, a mild acid (e.g., phosphoric acid) is dosed to correct the imbalance. All dosing is performed in closed-loop control using a PID algorithm. An interlock is set at pH < 4.2 or > 5.3 to initiate fermentation hold and trigger operator intervention, ensuring microbial viability and product consistency.

3.4 Agitation Control

Agitation is essential for maintaining homogeneity and oxygen transfer (during initial aerobic activation). The agitator operates at a variable speed of 60–120 RPM, controlled by a VFD (VSD-304) based on fermentation time and oxygen demand. During the first 2 hours, the system runs at 100 RPM; afterward, it gradually reduces to 70 RPM to reduce shear stress. A torque sensor monitors motor load to detect excessive viscosity or mechanical faults. In case of over-torque, an alarm is triggered at 150% rated load, and the agitator shuts down automatically above 180%.

3.5 Safety and Interlocks

Safety interlocks are configured to handle deviations beyond normal limits. These include:
	•	Overtemperature (>36 °C): Halts fermentation, stops agitator, and closes feed valves
	•	Overpressure (if sealed fermenter): Vents pressure through a relief valve (PIC-305 > 1.5 bar)
	•	Emergency Stop (E-STOP): Immediately shuts down all motors, dosing, and valves
	•	Sensor Faults: Redundant sensors trigger fault alarms and force manual mode
