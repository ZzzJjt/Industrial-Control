Control Narrative for Ethanol Production Process

Section 3: Fermentation

3.1 Temperature Control

The fermentation temperature must be precisely maintained between 32–35 °C to ensure optimal yeast activity and ethanol yield. A temperature transmitter continuously measures fermentation broth temperature, providing input to a PID temperature controller (TIC-301), which adjusts cooling jacket valves accordingly. If the temperature exceeds 36 °C or drops below 31 °C, alarms are triggered, prompting corrective actions or, in severe deviations (above 37 °C), automatic activation of emergency cooling and potential batch shutdown.

3.2 pH Regulation

Maintaining the fermentation broth pH between 4.5–5.0 is critical for yeast performance and process stability. A pH analyzer continuously monitors broth conditions, communicating with a PID pH controller (AIC-302). The controller modulates dosing pumps for acid/base additions as needed to maintain pH within the specified range. Alarms activate when the pH falls below 4.2 or rises above 5.3, prompting immediate manual checks and possible batch isolation if deviations persist.

3.3 Inoculation Procedure

Inoculation initiates fermentation through controlled introduction of yeast culture. A flow transmitter and automated dosing valve control yeast introduction, maintaining the inoculum addition rate at a predetermined flow rate. The inoculum volume and flow rate are monitored to match targeted concentrations precisely. Should the inoculum flow deviate significantly, alarms trigger immediate operator intervention to ensure proper yeast dosage and prevent suboptimal fermentation initiation.

3.4 Nutrient and Feed Management

Nutrient addition maintains yeast viability and metabolic efficiency throughout fermentation. Nutrient dosing pumps operate via flow transmitters and PID loops (FIC-303), precisely regulating nutrient feed rates based on continuous broth nutrient analysis. Alarms trigger at deviations of ±10% from target feed rates, prompting corrective adjustments or manual interventions to ensure yeast health and optimal ethanol yield.

3.5 Agitation Control

Consistent agitation ensures uniform nutrient distribution and optimal fermentation conditions. A variable-speed drive (VSD) connected to the fermenter agitator motor is modulated by a PID controller based on torque and viscosity feedback measurements. Agitator speed is maintained within a range of 150–200 RPM. Agitator failure or RPM deviation triggers an alarm and potentially initiates an emergency shutdown sequence if issues persist beyond safe operational limits.

3.6 Pressure Monitoring and Venting

Pressure in the fermentation tank is monitored continuously by a pressure transmitter (PIC-304) with a setpoint of 0.2–0.5 bar gauge. A vent valve with PID control regulates tank pressure, venting CO₂ appropriately. Alarms trigger if pressure rises above 0.6 bar or drops below atmospheric levels, automatically opening emergency vent valves or isolating the fermenter from feed inputs, ensuring operational safety and structural integrity.
