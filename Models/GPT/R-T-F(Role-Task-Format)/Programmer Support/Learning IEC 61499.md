\section*{Introduction}

IEC 61499 is an international standard that extends the IEC 61131-3 programming model to support modular, event-driven, and distributed industrial automation systems. It introduces new capabilities that are essential for next-generation control systems, including edge computing and IIoT applications. This guide is intended for engineers already proficient in IEC 61131-3 who are beginning to adopt IEC 61499.

\section*{Key Concepts of IEC 61499}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
  \item \textbf{Event-Driven Function Blocks:} Each function block (FB) includes explicit \texttt{EVENT} inputs and outputs. Execution is triggered by events rather than periodic scan cycles.
  \item \textbf{Separation of Event and Data Flows:} Events determine when actions are executed, while data ports carry values. This decoupling provides fine-grained control over sequencing and timing.
  \item \textbf{Distributed Deployment:} Applications can be distributed across multiple devices. FB networks are deployed as services communicating over standard interfaces.
  \item \textbf{Reusability and Modularity:} Function blocks can be composed hierarchically and reused across systems with improved interoperability due to XML-based design and vendor-neutral tools.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Feature} & \textbf{IEC 61131-3} & \textbf{IEC 61499} \\
\midrule
Execution Model & Scan-based (cyclic) & Event-driven \\
Modularity & Program/Function Block level & Hierarchical Function Block networks \\
Event Handling & Implicit (within scan cycle) & Explicit (EVENT inputs/outputs) \\
Architecture & Centralized controller & Distributed across multiple devices \\
Portability & Limited across platforms & XML-based, tool-independent \\
Timing Behavior & Fixed task cycle time & Event-triggered, flexible timing \\
Reuse & Code reuse (POUs) & Component reuse (FB networks) \\
Deployment & Single CPU/controller & Multi-device deployment \\

\section*{Function Block Example (IEC 61499)}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=,frame=single,basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
+-------------------------+
|  Basic Function Block   |
|-------------------------|
| EVENT Inputs | REQ      |
| DATA Inputs  | IN1, IN2 |
|              |          |
| ALGORITHM    | CALC     |
|              | OUT := IN1 + IN2 |
|-------------------------|
| EVENT Outputs| CNF      |
| DATA Outputs | OUT      |
+-------------------------+
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
In this example, an event input \texttt{REQ} triggers the execution of algorithm \texttt{CALC}, which computes the output \texttt{OUT}. Upon completion, an event output \texttt{CNF} signals the result.
