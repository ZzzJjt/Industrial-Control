I/O List for Feedwater Control in Steam-Water Cycle
1. Overview
This I/O list details 30 critical signals for feedwater control in the steam-water cycle of a power plant, ensuring precise monitoring and actuation of parameters like flow, pressure, level, and temperature. Feedwater control maintains proper water supply to the boiler drum, regulating drum level, pressure, and flow to prevent low-level trips or overfill conditions while optimizing boiler efficiency. The table includes signal characteristics such as type, range, setpoint, and P&ID reference, serving as a reliable reference for instrument selection, PLC/HMI configuration, and process documentation to support engineering, commissioning, and operational teams.
2. I/O List Table

3. Notes and Usage

Purpose: This I/O list serves as a reference for feedwater control in a steam-water cycle, supporting instrument selection, PLC/HMI configuration, and process documentation to ensure accurate integration and operational reliability.
Signal Selection: The 30 signals cover essential feedwater control parameters, including flow (FT-101, FT-105), level (LT-102, LT-109), pressure (PT-103, PT-108), temperature (TT-104, TT-114), conductivity (CT-111), pH (AT-115), and control/safety signals (FV-301, XS-205), reflecting typical power plant requirements.
Tag Number Convention: Follows ISA-5.1 standards (e.g., FT for flow transmitter, FV for flow valve), ensuring consistency across documentation.
Analog/Digital:
Analog signals (e.g., FT-101, FV-301) use 4–20 mA for precise measurements/control, typical in power plants.
Digital signals (e.g., ZS-201, YA-304) use 24 VDC for discrete states (on/off, alarm).


Ranges and Setpoints:
Ranges reflect operational limits (e.g., 0–2000 kg/h for feedwater flow, 0–100% for valve position).
Setpoints are typical targets (e.g., 1000 kg/h for flow, 50% for drum level), adjustable based on boiler size or operating conditions.


P&ID References: Hypothetical references (P&ID-FW-001 to P&ID-FW-008) link signals to process drawings for traceability; actual references depend on plant documentation.
Usage:
Instrument Selection: Guides selection of sensors (e.g., FT-101: coriolis flow meter) and actuators (e.g., FV-301: linear valve).
PLC Configuration: Maps signals to PLC tags (e.g., LT-102 to AI2, YC-305 to DO1).
HMI Configuration: Provides tag names and units for displays (e.g., "Drum Level: 50%").
Control Narrative: Aligns with control loops (e.g., LIC-102 for drum level, FIC-101 for feedwater flow).


Safety Considerations:
Includes emergency shutdown (XS-205), drum level alarms (LAH-203, LAL-204), and pump fault (XA-202) for safety.
Interlocks can be derived (e.g., stop pump if VT-119 > 10 mm/s or LAL-204 = 1).


Maintenance:
Table format supports Excel/PDF export for datasheets or documentation.
Clear tag numbers and P&ID references aid calibration (e.g., TT-104 monthly) and troubleshooting (e.g., check PT-106 for pump issues).



4. Assumptions

The steam-water cycle is for a medium-sized power plant boiler (e.g., 100 MW), with a single drum and standard feedwater system (pumps, deaerator, economizer).
Signals are based on typical feedwater control requirements; additional signals may be needed for specific boiler designs or auxiliary systems.
Ranges and setpoints are representative (e.g., 1000 kg/h flow, 50% drum level); actual values depend on boiler capacity and operating conditions.
PLC supports standard 4–20 mA analog I/O and 24 VDC digital I/O, with sufficient channels for 30 signals (22 analog, 8 digital).
P&ID references (P&ID-FW-001 to P&ID-FW-008) are hypothetical; actual drawings must be provided for real projects.

This I/O list provides a structured, standardized reference for feedwater control in a steam-water cycle, ensuring accurate instrumentation, PLC/HMI integration, and process documentation.
