Ammonium Nitrate Prilling Station Interlock List
This table lists interlocks for an ammonium nitrate prilling station, defining triggering conditions and automated responses to ensure safety and compliance. Each interlock uses fail-safe logic, latches until reset conditions are verified, and integrates into the PLC control system.



Interlock
Triggering Condition
Automated Response



Overtemperature
Melt temperature (TT-101) > 170°C
Shut down prill tower (stop melt feed via FV-101, disable prilling head PH-101), issue alarm (ALM-101), latch until TT-101 < 150°C and operator reset


High Pressure
Melt system pressure (PT-101) > 12 bar
Open relief valve (PRV-101), shut down melt pump (P-101), issue alarm (ALM-102), latch until PT-101 < 10 bar and operator reset


Low Cooling Air Flow
Cooling air flow (FT-101) < 500 m³/min
Halt melt feed (close FV-101), disable prilling head (PH-101), issue alarm (ALM-103), latch until FT-101 > 600 m³/min and operator reset


High Product Level
Prill accumulation level (LT-101) > 90% of bin capacity
Stop production (close FV-101, disable PH-101), issue alarm (ALM-104), latch until LT-101 < 80% and operator reset


Pump or Feeder Failure
Melt pump (P-101) or feeder (F-101) failure (e.g., no flow via FT-102 or motor fault)
Shut down prilling head (PH-101), close FV-101, issue alarm (ALM-105), latch until pump/feeder restored and operator reset


Scrubber Failure
Scrubber system (S-101) failure (e.g., pressure drop via PDT-101 < 0.5 kPa or motor fault)
Stop emissions source (close FV-101, disable PH-101), issue alarm (ALM-106), latch until scrubber restored and operator reset


Emergency Stop
Manual emergency stop button (ES-101) pressed
Shut down entire system (close FV-101, disable PH-101, stop P-101, open PRV-101), issue alarm (ALM-107), latch until operator reset


Inerting Gas Loss
Inerting gas pressure (PT-102) < 1 bar or flow (FT-103) < 50 L/min
Stop all processes (close FV-101, disable PH-101, stop P-101), issue alarm (ALM-108), latch until PT-102 > 1.5 bar, FT-103 > 60 L/min, and operator reset


Notes

Triggering Conditions:
Sensor thresholds (e.g., TT-101 > 170°C, PT-101 > 12 bar) are based on typical ammonium nitrate prilling safety limits; specific values may vary per design.
Fault detections (e.g., pump failure, scrubber failure) rely on sensor data (e.g., FT-102, PDT-101) or equipment status (e.g., motor fault).
Manual emergency stop is operator-initiated via a physical button or HMI command.


Automated Responses:
Shutdown: Stops melt feed (close FV-101), disables prilling head (PH-101), and halts pump (P-101) to cease prilling, ensuring a safe state.
Valve Operations: Open/close valves (e.g., PRV-101 open, FV-101 close) to control pressure or flow, typically pneumatic or solenoid-driven.
Alarms: Activate audible/visual alerts (ALM-101 to ALM-108) on HMI, logged with timestamps for traceability.
Latching: Interlocks remain active (e.g., valve closed, system off) until reset conditions (e.g., TT-101 < 150°C) and operator reset are met.


Fail-Safe Logic:
Defaults to safe state (e.g., FV-101 closed, PH-101 disabled) on fault detection or power loss.
Validates sensor data (e.g., TT-101 within 0–200°C) to prevent false triggers.
Requires manual reset to ensure operator verification before restart.


Assumptions:
Prilling station uses PLC with Profibus DP or similar for sensor/actuator communication.
Sensors (TT-101, PT-101, etc.) provide real-time data with millisecond response times.
Actions execute within seconds (e.g., valve closure <2s, shutdown <10s) to prevent escalation.
Alarms are integrated with SCADA/HMI for operator notification and logging.
Reset conditions include operator intervention (e.g., via HMI or physical switch) after verifying safe conditions.


Usage:
Low Cooling Air Flow: Halts melt feed, disables prilling head, issues ALM-103, latches until airflow restored.
High Pressure: Opens PRV-101, shuts down P-101, issues ALM-102, latches until pressure safe.
