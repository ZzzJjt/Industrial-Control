The narrative will be clear, actionable, and designed to ensure safe, efficient, and compliant operation while supporting PLC/DCS programming and future automation upgrades.

### Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Reactor

#### Overview
The ammonium nitrate reactor facilitates the exothermic reaction between ammonia (NH₃) and nitric acid (HNO₃) to produce ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) in aqueous solution. The process requires precise control of temperature, pressure, flow ratios, and pH to ensure safety, maximize yield, and comply with regulatory standards. This control narrative outlines the setpoints, instrumentation, operational sequences, and control logic to achieve consistent and safe reactor operation.

#### Operational Sequence
The reactor operation is divided into startup, steady-state, and shutdown phases, with automated control actions and operator inputs.

##### 1. Startup Procedure
- **Objective**: Safely initialize the reactor to reach operating conditions.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Pre-Startup Checks**:
     - Verify all valves (FV-101, FV-102, FV-103, TV-104, PV-106) are closed.
     - Confirm ammonia and nitric acid tank levels > 20% via level transmitters (LT-201, LT-202).
     - Check cooling water supply pressure > 3 bar (PT-203).
     - Ensure no active alarms or interlocks (TSH-107, PSH-108, ASH-109).
  2. **Initial Fill**:

     - Display real-time data on HMI with trend graphs.
  3. **Adjust for Disturbances**:
     - Increase cooling water flow (FIC-106) if temperature exceeds 177°C.
     - Reduce feed flows if pressure exceeds 5.0 bar or level > 60%.
     - Adjust ammonia flow if pH deviates from 6.2.
- **Automation**:

  5. **Standby**:
     - Stop agitator.
     - Close all valves except cooling water (FV-103 at 2 m³/h for standby cooling).
     - Update HMI status to "Standby."
- **Automation**:
  - Sequential logic to close feed valves and open cooling water.
  - PID control to ramp down temperature at 5°C/min.
  - Interlock to prevent draining until pressure < 0.5 bar.
  - Operator confirmation via HMI to complete shutdown.

#### Control Loops and Interlock Logic
- **Control Loops**:
  - **TIC-101 (Temperature)**: Dual PID loop; primary controls steam valve (TV-104) for heating, secondary controls cooling water (FV-103) for exothermic heat removal.
  - **PIC-102 (Pressure)**: PID loop adjusts feed flows and vent valve (PV-106) to maintain 4.8 bar.
  - **FRC-103 (Flow Ratio)**: Ratio control ensures ammonia flow is 1.01 times nitric acid flow, with feedback from FT-101 and FT-102.
  - **AIC-104 (pH)**: PID loop modulates ammonia valve (FV-101) to maintain pH 6.2.
  - **LIC-105 (Level)**: PID loop adjusts total feed flow (FV-101 + FV-102) to maintain 50% level.
  - **FIC-106 (Cooling Water)**: PID loop increases flow based on temperature deviation.

- **Interlocks and Alarms**:
  - **High Temperature (TSH-107)**: If temperature > 185°C (confirmed by TT-103), close feed valves (XV-101, XV-102), open vent valve (PV-106), and initiate emergency shutdown.
  - **High Pressure (PSH-108)**: If pressure > 5.2 bar, close feed valves (XV-101, XV-102) and open vent valve (PV-106).
  - **Low pH (ASH-109)**: If pH < 5.5, reduce nitric acid flow (FV-102) by 50%; if persists for 2 minutes, trigger shutdown.
  - **Low Level (LSL-110)**: If level < 20%, close feed valves to prevent pump cavitation.
  - **High Level (LSH-111)**: If level > 70%, reduce feed flows by 50%; if persists, trigger shutdown.
  - **Flow Imbalance**: If ammonia-to-acid ratio deviates by ±5% for 1 minute, trigger alarm and reduce flows.
  - **Equipment Faults**: Agitator motor fault or sensor failure (TT-101, PT-102, AT-104) triggers alarm and holds operation until resolved.
- **Emergency Shutdown**:
  - Close all feed valves (XV-101, XV-102).
  - Open vent valve (PV-106) and cooling water valve (FV-103) to maximum.
  - Stop agitator and open drain valve (XV-103) once pressure < 0.5 bar.
  - Notify operators via HMI and log event.

#### Monitoring and Operator Interface
- **Data Logging**:
