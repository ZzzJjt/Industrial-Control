### Explanation of Implementation
1. **Function Block Interface**:
   - **Inputs**:
     - `SearchArray`: `ARRAY[1..100] OF INT`, the sorted input array.
     - `TargetValue`: `INT`, the value to search for.
     - `Enable`: `BOOL`, triggers the search when `TRUE`.
   - **Outputs**:
     - `Found`: `BOOL`, indicates if the target was found.
     - `Index`: `INT`, returns the index (1..100) or -1 if not found.
   - **Internal Variables**:
     - `Low`, `High`, `Mid`: `INT`, manage search boundaries.
     - `SearchActive`: `BOOL`, prevents re-entry during a scan cycle.

2. **Internal Variables**:
   - `Low` and `High` initialize to 1 and 100, respectively, covering the full array.
   - `Mid` is computed as `Low + (High - Low) / 2` to avoid integer overflow and ensure integer division rounds down.
   - `SearchActive` ensures the search runs only once per `Enable` pulse, maintaining scan-cycle safety.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - **Trigger**: When `Enable = TRUE` and `SearchActive = FALSE`, the search begins.
   - **Validation**: Checks if `Low` and `High` are within bounds (1 to 100) and valid (`Low <= High`). An optional sorting check is commented out for performance, assuming the input is pre-sorted.
   - **WHILE Loop**:
     - Computes `Mid` and compares `SearchArray[Mid]` with `TargetValue`.
     - If equal, sets `Found := TRUE`, `Index := Mid`, and breaks the loop.
     - If `SearchArray[Mid] < TargetValue`, updates `Low := Mid + 1` (search upper half).
     - If `SearchArray[Mid] > TargetValue`, updates `High := Mid - 1` (search lower half).
     - Exits when `Low > High`, indicating the target is not found (`Index := -1`).
   - **Completion**: Resets `SearchActive := FALSE` after the search, ensuring one-shot execution.

4. **Outputs**:
   - `Found`: Set to `TRUE` if the target is found, `FALSE` otherwise.
   - `Index`: Returns the 1-based index (1 to 100) if found, -1 if not found or on error.
   - Outputs retain values between scans until the next `Enable` pulse, per PLC conventions.

5. **Validation and Documentation**:
   - **Input Validation**: Checks array bounds (`Low`, `High`) to prevent out-of-range access. Sorting validation is optional to optimize performance.
   - **Comments**: Detailed inline comments explain each step, including initialization, validation, search logic, and output handling.
   - **Maintainability**: Clear variable names (e.g., `TargetValue`, `SearchActive`) and structured logic enhance readability and debugging.

### Meeting Expectations
- **Robustness**:
  - **Scan-Cycle Safety**: The `WHILE` loop is bounded (max 7 iterations for 100 elements, completing in <1 ms on typical PLCs), ensuring execution within a single scan cycle (10â€“100 ms).
  - **Validation**: Checks for invalid bounds prevent errors, with a fallback to `Index := -1` on failure.
  - **Reliability**: Handles edge cases (e.g., target not in array, boundary values) correctly.
- **Reusability**:
  - The function block is self-contained, with a clear interface (`SearchArray`, `TargetValue`, `Enable`, `Found`, `Index`).
  - Can be instantiated multiple times for different arrays or searches within the same PLC program.
- **Modularity**:
  - Encapsulated logic within `FB_BinarySearch` supports reuse in other automation tasks (e.g., searching sensor data, setpoints).
  - Structured as a function block, following IEC 61131-3 best practices for modularity.
- **Adaptability**:
  - **Fixed Array**: Designed for `ARRAY[1..100] OF INT`, but the logic can be modified for dynamic sizes by adding `ARRAY[*]` and bounds inputs (e.g., `StartIndex`, `EndIndex`).
  - **Data Types**: Currently uses `INT`, but can be adapted for other types (e.g., `REAL`, `DINT`) with minor changes to comparisons.
  - **Future Use Cases**: Supports extensions like searching partially sorted arrays or handling multiple targets with additional logic.
- **Efficiency**:
  - Binary search achieves O(log n) complexity (max 7 iterations for 100 elements), far faster than linear search (O(n)).
  - Minimizes computational load, suitable for real-time PLC environments.
- **Documentation**:
  - Inline comments detail initialization, validation, search algorithm, and output behavior.
  - Clear structure and variable names enhance maintainability and onboarding.

### Additional Notes
- **Performance**: The binary search completes in <7 iterations, taking negligible time (<1 ms) even on slower PLCs, ensuring scan-cycle safety. For very large arrays, consider iterative limits to cap iterations per cycle.
- **Validation Trade-Off**: Sorting validation is omitted for performance, assuming pre-sorted input (common in automation for static lookup tables). Enable the commented sorting check if input reliability is uncertain.
- **Adaptability**: To support dynamic array sizes, modify the interface to include `StartIndex` and `EndIndex`, and use `ANY_INT` for generic types, though this requires vendor-specific support (e.g., CODESYS).
- **Safety**: The function block is stateless between `Enable` pulses, avoiding persistent state issues in cyclic execution. Add explicit fault outputs (e.g., `Fault_Code`) for production if needed.
- **Compliance**: Aligns with IEC 61131-3 standards for function blocks, ensuring portability across platforms (e.g., CODESYS, TwinCAT, Siemens).

This function block is ready for deployment in a real-time PLC environment, providing an efficient and reusable binary search utility. If you need extensions (e.g., dynamic arrays, additional validation, or specific PLC platform tweaks), please provide details, and I can refine the code further!
