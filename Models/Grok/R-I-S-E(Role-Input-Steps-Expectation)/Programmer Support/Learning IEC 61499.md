Introduction to IEC 61499 for IEC 61131-3 Engineers
1. Overview of IEC 61499
IEC 61499 is an international standard for distributed industrial automation systems, published by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 2005 and updated in subsequent editions. Building on the function block concept from IEC 61131-3, it addresses the needs of modern, flexible, and distributed control systems in Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments. Its purpose is to enable modular, event-driven, and interoperable control applications that can be distributed across networked devices, supporting dynamic reconfiguration and scalability in smart manufacturing.
2. Key Concepts of IEC 61499
IEC 61499 introduces several concepts that extend and diverge from IEC 61131-3, tailored for distributed and flexible automation:

Function Blocks:
Basic Function Blocks (BFBs): Encapsulate control logic with event and data inputs/outputs, similar to IEC 61131-3 but with explicit event handling.
Composite Function Blocks (CFBs): Combine multiple BFBs or other CFBs into reusable modules, enhancing modularity.
Service Interface Function Blocks (SIFBs): Interface with hardware or external systems (e.g., sensors, actuators, or communication protocols), enabling device-specific operations.


Event-Data Separation: Unlike IEC 61131-3, where data and control are tightly coupled, IEC 61499 separates event signals (triggering execution) from data signals (processed values). This allows precise control over when and how function blocks execute.
Event-Driven Execution Model: Function blocks execute in response to events rather than a fixed scan cycle, enabling asynchronous and responsive control. Execution is governed by event connections, defined in an application’s network.
Distribution Across Networked Devices: IEC 61499 applications can be deployed across multiple controllers or devices (e.g., PLCs, edge devices) via a system-level configuration. This supports decentralized control, where function blocks communicate over networks using protocols like Ethernet or OPC UA.

3. Comparison with IEC 61131-3



Aspect
IEC 61131-3
IEC 61499



Architecture
Centralized: Logic runs on a single PLC or controller, with tightly coupled I/O and program execution.
Distributed: Logic is distributed across networked devices, with function blocks mapped to specific hardware.


Execution Model
Scan-based: Cyclic execution where the entire program is scanned at fixed intervals (e.g., 10–100 ms).
Event-driven: Function blocks execute only when triggered by events, supporting asynchronous and dynamic behavior.


Flexibility for Distributed Control
Limited: Designed for single-device control, with extensions (e.g., Modbus, Profibus) for communication.
High: Native support for distributed systems, enabling seamless deployment across devices and dynamic reconfiguration.


Portability and Reuse
Moderate: Function blocks are reusable within a project but tied to a specific PLC’s runtime environment.
High: Function blocks are portable across compliant platforms, with standardized interfaces and event-driven design enhancing modularity.


Key Differences:

IEC 61131-3 is ideal for traditional, centralized PLC applications (e.g., factory automation with fixed cycles), but struggles with dynamic, multi-device systems.
IEC 61499 excels in distributed, reconfigurable systems (e.g., smart factories, IIoT), where event-driven control and interoperability are critical.
Transitioning engineers should note that IEC 61499 requires a shift from scan-based thinking to event-driven design, emphasizing explicit event handling and network configuration.
