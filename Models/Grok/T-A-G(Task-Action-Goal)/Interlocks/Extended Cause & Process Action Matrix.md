Matrix Notes

✅: Indicates the safety action is triggered for the corresponding cause.
Causes: Cover a range of hazardous conditions, including process deviations (e.g., overpressure, overheating), equipment malfunctions (e.g., sensor or valve failures), and external threats (e.g., fire, gas leaks).
Actions:
Shut Inlet Valves: Stops reactant inflow to prevent escalation.
Open Vent Valve: Relieves pressure to avoid rupture.
Activate Emergency Cooling: Reduces temperature to safe levels.
Isolate Feed Pumps: Halts feed supply to stabilize the process.
Trigger Alarm: Alerts operators for manual intervention.
Initiate Emergency Shutdown: Safely shuts down the reactor.
Activate Fire Suppression: Mitigates fire or explosion risks.


Each cause triggers at least one action, with critical conditions (e.g., overpressure, fire) activating multiple responses for layered protection.
