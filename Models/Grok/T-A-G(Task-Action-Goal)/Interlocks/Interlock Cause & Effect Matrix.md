Matrix Notes

✅: Indicates the safety action is triggered for the corresponding cause.
Causes: Include process deviations (e.g., high/low pressure, temperature, level, flow) and equipment failures (e.g., sensor or communication issues).
Effects:
Trigger Alarm: Alerts operators for immediate awareness.
Stop Feed Pump: Halts reactant feed to prevent escalation.
Close Inlet Valve: Stops inflow to stabilize conditions.
Open Vent Valve: Relieves pressure to avoid rupture.
Stop Heater: Reduces temperature to safe levels.
Initiate Shutdown: Safely shuts down the reactor for critical conditions.


Each cause triggers at least two actions, ensuring layered protection and operator notification.
