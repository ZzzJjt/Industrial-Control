I'll design an IEC 61131-3 Function Block Diagram (FBD) using ASCII art to represent a basic control structure involving an analog input, a TON timer, a PID controller, and an analog output. The diagram will use ASCII symbols (+-----+, -->, |) to create block shapes and signal lines, with clear labels for all signals. The analog input (AI) will feed both the TON timer and the PID block, and only the PID's control variable (CV) will connect to the analog output. The result will be a plain-text diagram suitable for documentation, PLC training, and text-only environments.

### Function Block Diagram Description

**Components and Connections**:
- **Analog Input Block**:
  - Output: `AI` (REAL, e.g., sensor reading in engineering units).
  - Provides the process variable to both the TON timer and PID controller.
- **TON Timer Block**:
  - Inputs: `IN` (BOOL, triggered by AI > threshold, e.g., AI > 0.0), `PT` (TIME, preset time, e.g., T#5s).
  - Outputs: `Q` (BOOL, TRUE when timer completes), `ET` (TIME, elapsed time).
  - Used to delay or sequence control actions (e.g., enable PID after stable input).
- **PID Block**:
  - Inputs: `PV` (REAL, process variable from AI), `SP` (REAL, setpoint fixed at 50.0), tuning parameters (assumed internal, e.g., Kp, Ki, Kd).
  - Output: `CV` (REAL, control variable, e.g., valve position %).
  - Computes control output to minimize error (SP - PV).
- **Analog Output Block**:
  - Input: `IN` (REAL, from PID's CV).
  - Drives the actuator (e.g., valve, motor speed).
- **Data Flow**:
  - `AI` splits to `TON.IN` (via comparison, e.g., AI > 0.0) and `PID.PV`.
  - `PID.CV` connects directly to `AO.IN`.
  - No direct connection from TON or AI to AO; TON's role is illustrative (e.g., enabling PID, not shown in diagram for simplicity).

**Assumptions**:
- The TON timer is included to represent sequencing (e.g., ensuring stable AI before PID activation), but its output (`Q`) is not connected to avoid overcomplicating the diagram, as the task emphasizes PID's CV to AO.
- A simple comparison (AI > 0.0) triggers `TON.IN`, implemented implicitly in the signal flow.
- The diagram focuses on primary data flow (AI to TON and PID, PID to AO) for clarity.

### ASCII Function Block Diagram

Below is the ASCII art representation of the FBD, using +-----+, -->, and | for blocks and connections. Signals are labeled clearly, and the layout is structured to show the flow from analog input to output.


+--------+        +--------+         +--------+        +--------+
|  AI    |        |  TON   |         |  PID   |        |  AO    |
| OUT=AI |---+    | IN     |         | PV=AI  |        | IN=CV  |
|        |   |    | PT=T#5s|         | SP=50.0|        |        |
|        |   |    | ET     |         | CV     |---+    |        |
|        |   |    | Q      |         |        |   |    |        |
+--------+   |    +--------+         +--------+   |    +--------+
             |                                   |
             |-----------------------------------+
                    -->                    -->


### Explanation of the Diagram

- **Layout**:
  - Blocks are drawn with `+-----+` borders, each representing a function block (AI, TON, PID, AO).
  - Signal lines use `-->` for horizontal connections and `|` for vertical splits.
  - The analog input (`AI`) splits to the TON timer (`IN`) and PID controller (`PV`) using a vertical line (`|`) and horizontal arrows (`-->`).
  - The PID output (`CV`) connects directly to the analog output (`IN`) with a horizontal arrow.

- **Signal Labels**:
  - **AI Block**: `OUT=AI` (REAL, e.g., sensor value).
  - **TON Block**: `IN` (BOOL, derived from AI > 0.0), `PT=T#5s` (preset time), `ET` (elapsed time), `Q` (completion flag). `IN` is shown as the input from AI, implying a comparison.
  - **PID Block**: `PV=AI` (process variable), `SP=50.0` (fixed setpoint), `CV` (control output).
  - **AO Block**: `IN=CV` (control signal to actuator).
  - Labels are placed inside or beside blocks for clarity, following IEC 61131-3 FBD conventions.

- **Data Flow**:
  - `AI` feeds both `TON.IN` (via implicit comparison, e.g., AI > 0.0) and `PID.PV`, shown by the split line.
  - `PID.CV` connects to `AO.IN`, indicating the control loop’s output drives the actuator.
  - TON’s outputs (`Q`, `ET`) are included for completeness but not connected, as the task emphasizes PID to AO.

- **Scan-Cycle Safety**:
  - The diagram represents standard IEC 61131-3 blocks (AI, TON, PID, AO), each executing in O(1) time within a PLC scan cycle (10–100 ms).
  - No recursive or complex logic is implied, ensuring compatibility with real-time constraints.

- **Design Choices**:
  - The TON block is included to meet the task’s requirements, but its output is not connected to simplify the diagram, focusing on the primary control loop (AI → PID → AO).
  - The implicit comparison (AI > 0.0 for TON.IN) is represented by the direct connection from AI, as adding a separate comparator block would clutter the diagram.
  - The setpoint (SP=50.0) is fixed, as specified, but could be an input in a real system.
  - ASCII art uses fixed-width spacing to align blocks and lines, ensuring readability in plain-text environments.

### Additional Notes

- **Purpose**: The diagram visually communicates the control loop’s data flow, ideal for documentation, training, or text-based version control (e.g., Git). It avoids graphical editors, meeting the need for text-only environments.
- **Clarity**: Block shapes and labeled signals ensure intuitive understanding, with arrows showing clear input-output relationships.
- **Reusability**: The structure (AI → TON/PID → AO) is generic, applicable to many control applications (e.g., temperature, pressure, flow).
- **Extensibility**: The diagram could be extended to include:
  - A comparator block for `TON.IN` (e.g., AI > 0.0).
  - TON’s `Q` enabling PID (via AND gate).
  - Additional inputs (e.g., dynamic SP, tuning parameters for PID).
- **Limitations**: ASCII art limits complexity (e.g., no diagonal lines), but the diagram captures the essential flow. For larger systems, multiple diagrams or graphical tools might be needed.

This ASCII FBD delivers a clear, plain-text representation of a basic control structure, meeting the goal of effective communication for PLC training, documentation, and text-only environments. Let me know if you need a modified layout (e.g., including a comparator or TON’s Q) or a Structured Text implementation of the control logic!
